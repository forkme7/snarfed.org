SoMa Launch Party

A few years ago, [a friend](http://kemblescott.com/) of
[a friend](http://www.richterscales.com/jerry)
approached me with
[a book he'd written](http://kemblescott.com/).
He was looking for people to critique it and copy edit a few early drafts,
before it was in galleys, while he shopped it around to publishers.

I obliged, and it turned out to be strikingly good. It focuses on sexuality,
which it addresses from a number of intriguing perspectives. It's also set in
the
[South of Market district](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_of_Market%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California)
of San Francisco, its namesake, which ends up playing a major role in its own
right.

We went to the launch party last night, held at the charming
[Le Colonial](http://www.lecolonialsf.com/), and we had a great time.
[Books Inc.](http://www.booksinc.net/) was selling freshly printed copies, so
we bought a couple for Scott to sign. We congratulated him on making the
[Chronicle's best seller list](http://sfgate.com/eguide/books/bestsellers/),
joked about the book's early days, and caught up with a bunch of old friends.

I've already recommended [SoMa](http://kemblescott.com/) to lots of friends.
If you're looking for something thought-provoking, and don't mind stretching
your mind a bit, it's a great read. Better yet, go to one of the
[Bay Area signings](http://kemblescott.com/?page=meet-kemble) and meet the
author in person!

Congratulations, Scott. You deserve it.

(P.S. Pictures from [the ballet](/2007-01-29_san_francisco_ballet_opening_gala),
Vegas and New Orleans are coming. Eventually. Promise!)
