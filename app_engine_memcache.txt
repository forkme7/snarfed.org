App Engine memcache: shared vs dedicated

[Google App Engine](http://appengine.google.com/) has two self-explanatory
options for [memcache](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached):
[shared and dedicated](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/memcache).
For [Bridgy](http://brid.gy/), we've used shared, which is pretty stingy,
averaging 1-3MB total cache space. Our oldest entry is usually just an hour or
so old.

Dedicated would obviously be better, but it costs money:
[$.06/GB/hour](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/pricing#cost_resource) ie
$1.44/GB/day. Still, I tried it for a couple days to see what the difference
would be.

Answer: not much. We definitely got more space, but it didn't seem to noticeably
change request latency, cache hit ratio, frontend instances, or anything else
meaningful. Graphs below. I switched to dedicated at around -2.5d, and switched
back at around -.75d.

A few interesting conclusions:

* Right now, we actually like the fact that our memcache entries expire fairly quickly, at least for a couple things: discovered [webmention](http://webmention.org/) endpoints and resolved URLs (ie followed redirects). With a dedicated 1GB of cache, those would probably last for months, so we'd need to start setting an expiration on them.
* Hit ratio didn't change much. That means our cache misses are mostly due to wholly new items, not to old items that got evicted.

It's also interesting that almost a day after I switched back to shared
memcache, our cache data wasn't flushed, which implies we stayed in the
dedicated area and just got capped at the current size at that point. Maybe
there's an infrequent cron job that moves apps back to shared.
