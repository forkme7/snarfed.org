[GeoUrl](http://geourl.org/) is a nifty site that maps web sites to geographical locations, similar to [geocoding](/geocoding). It also maintains this index in reverse, which you can use to find sites located near other sites in the real world.

To connect your web page to GeoUrl, [follow their instructions](http://geourl.org/add.html) to find your coordinates and add an ICBM header to your page. Then, [ping GeoUrl](http://geourl.org/ping/) with your site. Finally, add a link to other sites near your own, like so:

[http://geourl.org/near/?p=http://snarfed.org/](http://geourl.org/near/?p=http://snarfed.org/)

The [buttons](/buttons) page has a convenient GeoUrl icon:
