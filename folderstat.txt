For the impatient:  
[Download folderstat.cpp](/folderstat.cpp)

[Folderstat](/folderstat.cpp) is a program that reports the
sizes of each of the folders in an IMAP account. It uses
[pine](http://www.washington.edu/pine/) as an IMAP client, so you'll need to
have an IMAP account set up in pine, and you'll need to have pine in your path.

Unless you have pine set up to use ssh-agent or a password file, it will ask you
to authenticate once for each folder, so it's not really useful for accounts
that use SSL/TLS or otherwise require authentication. However, it is a decent
example of iostreams and STL usage in C++.

To compile on \*nix, just do `g++ folderstat.cpp`. On Windows, just load it in
your IDE of choice and compile it. :P

Eventually, I might re-implement this using Python's
[imaplib](http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-imaplib.html), including
support for authenticating to GSS-API capable imap servers.
