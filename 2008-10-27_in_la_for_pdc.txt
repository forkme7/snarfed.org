In LA for PDC

I'm in LA this week for Microsoft's [PDC 2008](http://microsoftpdc.com/).
They're
[announcing their cloud stuff](http://www.informationweek.com/news/windows/operatingsystems/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=211600010),
so since I work on
[Google App Engine](http://appengine.google.com/), I'm here to do a little
competitive research. (I tried to convince my co-workers that I needed James
Bond style spy gear, but no luck.)

Drop me a line if you're at PDC too, or if you're just in town and want to catch
up! I'll be at the conference during the daytime, but I'll be around for
dinner or drinks most nights.
