Thought experiment

Say you have two apples. The first is local, organic, sustainable, grown on a
family farm and delivered to your neighborhood farmer's market by a smiling
Johnny Appleseed. The second is from GMO seeds, grown with pesticides, grown by
the farm-industrial complex and sold to a big box supermarket.

However. Nutritionally, chemically, down to the atom, the apples are identical.
They had equivalent impacts on the environment. All workers involved were paid
the same living wage and treated equally. As far as their effects on the world
at large, on your body when you eat them, the apples are indistinguishable.

Is the organic apple still "better" somehow? If so, how?

Yes, I know this is impossible. It's a thought experiment. Not a very
politically correct one, granted, but humor me. I obviously have my own opinion,
but I'm sincerely curious what you all think. Is there an inherent, ineffable
righteousness to local-organic-sustainable? Or is it just the concrete
differences to nutrition
([if any](http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2012/september/organic.html)),
environment, and socioeconomics that matter? If we're working toward eliminating
those differences, will that ever be enough?

Which apple would you choose, and why?
