Fargo's not Well

[Theft puts Wells Fargo customer IDs, SSNs at
risk](http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/business/7326113.htm)

(from the Merc)

So, this is depressing. Worse, it's wildly misreported in lots of places. Most
accounts somehow blame the computer security practices at Wells Fargo, and
either downplay or completely omit the fact that this was a _burglary_!
Literally, someone broke a window and grabbed a bunch of stuff, coincidentally
including a laptop computer. They probably had no idea it had customer SSNs and
bank account numbers on it.

The _real_ story is the subcontractor in India who recently tried to blackmail
UCSF. She had sensitive patient files, and threatened to publish them unless she
got paid what she felt she deserved. When sensitive, personally identifying
information gets copied down long chains of people and companies, each link is
one more opportunity to for negligence. Laws are harder to enforce, and rules
inside any one company don't apply.

It's all well and good to debate this stuff, but when your SSN, credit card
number, and birth certificate get plastered on a web site, you don't want
debate. You want it stopped.
