A new kingdom

Reach back into the murky depths of your high school biology class. I know, it's
been a long time, but stick with me. Remember the
[kingdoms of life](http://biology.about.com/od/evolution/a/aa091004a.htm)?
Animals, plants, fungus, bacteria, etc? We may still be debating other things,
like virii, and sure, there are millions of individual species and even families
we haven't discovered yet...but the kingdoms are pretty obvious. Those can't
change.

A [friend of mine](http://danielwilkerson.com/) works on data mining genetic
sequences from communicable diseases, and he dropped a whopper in my lap
recently at a dinner party. They routinely go to hospitals and other clinics to
work with samples in the field, and when they brought one back to the lab a bit
ago, they found that they'd discovered not just a new species, or a new family,
but an _entirely new kingdom_: a fungus that can locomote. Literally, a walking
slime monster straight out of a B movie.

(I don't have a citation, but I wish I did. I'll post a link here as soon as I
find one.)

It blew my mind. I don't think about the kingdoms of life often, but I
definitely assumed they covered everything. It consistently amazes me how much
we still don't know about biology. Can you imagine discovering something that
huge on a normal work day, not even on purpose, just going about your business?
So crazy.
