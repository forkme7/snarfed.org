Cleanse

<p class="right"><img src="healthy_foods.jpg"></p>

I'm starting a
[cleanse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detoxification_%28alternative_medicine%29#Detox_diets)
today! It's not a New Years resolution - I don't tend to do those - but for the
next three weeks, I'm cutting out alcohol, caffeine, sugar, wheat (gluten),
dairy, and meat. Seafood is ok, and I'll probably have the occasional piece of
dark chocolate or lightly caffeinated tea, but that's it.

This is a "blacklist" kind of cleanse, as opposed to a "whitelist" that lets you
have only orange juice, or only rutebaga and sardines, or only raw plants you
pull out of the ground yourself. Those just seem silly.

I generally eat healthy, but I'm not hardcore. I'll happily gobble down the
occasional pork belly, croissant, half a chocolate cake, or five drinks or cups
of coffee in a day. Even without the excess, days without wheat or dairy or
sugar are the exception, not the rule, and days without coffee or alcohol are
rare indeed.

Even so, I'm happy with my diet overall, so I'm doing this mostly just for the
experience. It's not an obvious one to seek out, but I'm sure it will be
interesting!

Props for the inspiration and motivation go to
[Gina](https://profiles.google.com/girossma), who's always trying different
cleanses, and [Schemer](http://www.schemer.com/), a great new webapp for
discovering fun things to do. Wish me luck!
