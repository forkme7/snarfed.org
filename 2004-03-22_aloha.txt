Aloha

Umm...well the kids went to [Hawaii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii) so I'm
going to fill in while they're gone...umm...I think I'll just show you the [best
pictures of 2003](http://www.fifth-essence.com/archive/bestpix2003/) and if they
find something on the islands that will qualify for the best pictures of 2004,
we'll celebrate with some [cookies](http://www.girlscoutcookiesabc.com/atc/)
next year :-)
