## Experience

### [Doing a startup](/2013-02-27_leaving_google), 2013 onward


### [Google Inc.](http://www.google.com/), 2003 - 2013

#### December 2011 - February 2013

Helped design and build a large scale, product independent personalization
infrastructure system used by almost all of Google's top consumer products. It's
best described by
the [privacy
policy changes](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/updating-our-privacy-policies-and-terms.html) we launched in March 2012.


#### June 2010 - December 2011

Led and contributed to multiple network management projects for Google's
backbone network,
[AS15169](http://www.peeringdb.com/view.php?asn=15169), including
command and control, monitoring, automation, topology, routing, peering,
[and
 OpenFlow](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/04/going-with-the-flow-google/).


#### December 2005 - April 2010

Co-founded [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/) and led its
[datastore](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/datastore/overview.html)
engineering team. App Engine is a widely used
[PaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaaS#Platform) style cloud computing
platform. The datastore is a large scale,
[replicated](http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2009/09/migration-to-better-datastore.html),
distributed structured storage system used by both App Engine and other Google
products. Includes a dynamic query planner, full featured transaction engine,
rich structured primary keys, real-time index management, and semantic typing.
Scales to >XXXB rows, >XPB of data, and >XXXkqps.


#### April 2006 - Dec. 2006

Led Google's early adoption of [OpenID](http://openid.net/).
Evangelized OpenID internally, built a number of prototypes, addressed
security concerns, and got buy-in from execs. Implemented the first projects,
[commenting in Blogger](http://snarfed.org/2007-12-02_openid_comments_in_blogger) and the
[App Engine provider](http://openid-provider.appspot.com/) and
[consumer](http://openid-consumer.appspot.com/), and coordinated the
[Blogger OpenID provider](http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/2008/01/new-feature-blogger-as-openid-provider.html).
This led to widespread adoption, culminating in a full Google Accounts
[provider](http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OpenID.html) and
[consumer](http://code.google.com/apis/apps/sso/openid_reference_implementation.html).


#### June 2003 - March 2006

Co-founder and a lead engineer on Moneta, Google's transaction processing
platform. It handles OLTP, rating, billing, invoicing, payments, and revenue
share for dozens of billing models and payment methods, hundreds of countries
and currencies, >XXM customers, >XB transactions per day, >XXkqps, and 99.98%
uptime.

I also led two large migrations. First was from Google's old billing/OLTP system
to Moneta. We migrated millions of customers online, without downtime, ahead of
schedule and with a fallout rate of under .01% needing manual intervention.

Second was to [BFS](http://www.bfs-finance.com/) (now AFS), our third party billing
partner. This included more advertisers and publishers, multiple corporate
entities, and dozens of different billing models and payment methods. We again
migrated everything without downtime and with a fallout rate of under .1%.



### [IBM Almaden Research Center](http://almaden.ibm.com/), 2002 - 2003

Joined [Extreme Blue](http://www.ibm.com/extremeblue/) to work on DALI, an which
enables scientists to share molecule data and analysis code over the Internet.
Used SOAP, OGSA, UDDI, DB2, and Java. Developed a dynamic parallelizing
algorithm for running large networked analyses. Implemented intelligent caching
and routing mechanisms for data and analyses.

Afterward, designed and implemented a workflow framework, catalog, and
description language used to run molecular analyses for life sciences research
projects.


### [LucasArts Entertainment Co.](http://www.lucasarts.com/), summer 2001

Worked on the
 _[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter](http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-bounty-hunter)
game. Wrote a triangle re-optimizer and other tools for the graphics engine.
Developed a full-featured windowing system in OpenGL for the game's GUI.
Developed a multi-channel streaming audio library for Playstation 2.



### [Webvan Group](http://www.disobey.com/ghostsites/show_exhibit.shtml/webvan),
summer 2000

Designed and implemented a networked warehouse management system using sensors,
conveyor belts, bar code readers with custom TCP/IP stacks, and an Oracle
server. Also wrote an automatically regressed emulator for the system.

Wrote web-based PL/SQL utilities for modifying in-process orders on the fly.



#### [Electronic Arts](http://www.ea.com/), summer 1999

Quality Assurance Tester


#### MobileForce Technologies, summer 1998

Software Developer
