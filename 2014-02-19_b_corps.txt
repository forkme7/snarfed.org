B corps

<p class="third right">

Over the last few years, a third of the US states have signed laws creating a
new type of company: the
[benefit corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation), or _B
corp._ I love them. They rock. I want one when I grow up.

Traditional companies are expected to maximize shareholder profits as their
primary goal, a maxim that has been upheld in the courts. This makes them
reluctant to pursue social goods or other initiatives that might detract from
shareholder value.

B corps, on the other hand, are measured by the general public benefit they
provide. Shareholders and boards of directors judge them on whether they have a
"material positive impact on society and the environment," explicitly allowing
them - requiring them! - to work toward social good instead of profit alone.

I've never had much patience for the "big companies are evil, capitalism is
evil" dogma. It's a shallow, intellectually lazy idea that we all fall for
because it tells a good story. Who doesn't love an easy scapegoat? Sadly, it's
all too easy to dismiss different perspectives on the world as "evil" instead of
actually engaging with them. At a high enough level, I think we all want (very
roughly) the same things; we just
[disagree on specifics](/2012-05-21_first_agree_on_the_goal) like which things
come first and how to approach them.

In the same vein, I think
[individual people and organizations matter less than we think](/2013-04-30_people-dont-matter),
and environments and incentives matter way more. Unfortunately,
[complex systems are notoriously hard to get right](/2011-12-09_can_software_learn_from_nuclear_power),
and even harder to change without causing more problems than you solve.
Capitalism is one of the most successful systems the world has ever seen, but
despite a steady stream of tweaks over the last couple centuries - central
banks, antitrust laws, labor unions, investor regulations - it's not out
of the woods yet.

My knee jerk reaction to "big companies are evil" is to blame the system, but
it's always nagged at me. Fixing systems is hard, and capitalism is a beast. How
the hell do we do it? Historical alternatives like socialism and fascism clearly
don't work. The Occupy movement's
[General Assembly](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/10/05/141048592/occupy-wall-street-where-everybody-has-a-say-in-everything)
is just the latest
[incarnation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy)
[of older](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics)
[ideas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarchy) that are interesting but
impractical. Modern China may be the most promising candidate yet, with its
hierarchy and experimental meritocracy, but it's far too early to tell.

In the interest of
[incremental development](/2012-03-25_how_should_groups_make_decisions), B
corps are my new favorite answer. They're not perfect, to be sure. They're not
even strictly necessary! Corporations aren't actually required to maximize
shareholder profit as strictly as we think, and B corps could
[create a dangerous double standard](https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2012/05/13/benefit-corporations-vs-regular-corporations-a-harmful-dichotomy/).
Regardless, perception is reality. If we _think_ corporations are required to
profit above all else, that chilling effect is hard to fight without addressing
it explicitly. B corps are a blowtorch. Bring on the flames!
