B corps

In the last few years, over a third of the states in the US have signed laws
creating a new type of company: the
[benefit corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation) or _B
corp._ Traditional companies are generally expected to maximize shareholder
profits as their primary goal, a maxim that has been upheld in the courts. This
makes them reluctant to pursue social goods or other initiatives that might
detract from shareholder value.

B corps, on the other hand are measured by the general public benefit they
provide. Shareholders and boards of directors judge whether B corps have a
"material positive impact on society and the environment," which gives them
explicit freedom and protection for working toward social goods instead of
profit alone.

Hell yes! Bring on the B corps, I say!

I've never had much patience for the "big companies are evil, capitalism is
evil" dogma. It's a shallow, intellectually lazy idea that we all fall for
because it tells a good story. Who doesn't love an easy scapegoat? Sadly, it's
all too easy to dismiss different perspectives on the world as "evil" instead of
actually engaging with them. At a high enough level, we all generally want the
same things; we just
[disagree on specifics](/2012-05-21_first_agree_on_the_goal) like which ones
come first and how to approach them.

Just as importantly,
[individual people and organizations matter less than we think](/2013-04-30_people_dont_matter),
and environments and incentives matter way more. Unfortunately,
[complex systems are notoriously hard to get right](/2011-12-09_can_software_learn_from_nuclear_power),
and even harder to modify without causing more problems than you solve.
Capitalism is one of the most successful systems the world has ever seen, but
despite a stream of adjustments over the last couple centuries - central banks,
antitrust laws, labor unions, investor regulations - it's still not out of the
woods yet.

For a while now, my knee jerk reaction to "big companies are evil" has generally
been "blame the system." It's nagged at me, though. Fixing systems is hard, and
capitalism is a beast of a system. How the hell do we fix that system?
Historical alternatives like socialism and fascism clearly aren't it. The Occupy
movement's
[General Assembly](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/10/05/141048592/occupy-wall-street-where-everybody-has-a-say-in-everything)
is the latest [incarnation of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy)
[older](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics)
[ideas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarchy) that are interesting, but
impractical. Modern China may be the most promising candidate yet, with its
hierarchy and experimental meritocracy, but it's far too early to tell.

In the interest of
[incremental development](/2012-03-25_how_should_groups_make_decisions.txt), B
corps are my new favorite answer for how to "fix" capitalism. They're not
perfect, to be sure. They're not even strictly necessary; corporations aren't
bound nearly as tightly to maximizing shareholder profit as we generally think,
and B corps could
[create a dangerous double standard](https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2012/05/13/benefit-corporations-vs-regular-corporations-a-harmful-dichotomy/).

Regardless, perception is reality. If we _think_ corporations are bound to
profit above all else, that chilling effect is hard to fight without something
that addresses it explicitly. In that sense, B corps are a blowtorch. Bring on
the flames!
