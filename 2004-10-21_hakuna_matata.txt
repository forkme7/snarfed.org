Over the weekend, I went with my family to see the [Lion King
musical](http://www.disney.co.uk/MusicalTheatre/TheLionKing/). It was playing at
the [Orpheum Theatre](http://www.bestofbroadway-sf.com/orpheum.html), just
blocks from my apartment...so I convinced my parents to try
[MUNI](http://sfmuni.com/) instead of driving. This worked out well, since it
started pouring rain as soon as we left my apartment.

But I digress. The show was incredible. It was a solid play in its own right,
and the cast was great, but the real stars were the costumes and the music. They
had people in giraffe costumes on four-legged stilts, soaring birds on
impossibly tall poles, massive elephants that dwarfed the stage, and that's just
the beginning. I was also impressed at how well the costumes - and the actors! -
portrayed animals that don't look or move remotely like humans.

The music was similarly unusual and cool. It included most of the familiar songs
from the movie, but with a distinct African flair, It also included other
African music, dancing, and authentic instruments, all well executed.

On a diferent note, I was happy to see that a big, traditional entertainment
company like [Disney](http://disney.com/) had the guts to produce something like
this. To say it's not their standard fare would be an understatement. :P I'm
glad they did, though, since we all had a lot of fun.
