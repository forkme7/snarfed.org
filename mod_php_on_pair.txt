mod_php on pair.com

Got a shared hosting account on [pair.com](http://pair.com/)? Want to run a PHP
script under Apache's `mod_php` module, instead of as CGI? Here's a tip:
*don't* put the `.php` file under the `cgi-bin/` directory.

This took me literally hours to figure out.
[Pair's documentation](http://www.pair.com/support/knowledge_base/)
is generally pretty good, and they have plenty of information about
[PHP](http://www.pair.com/support/knowledge_base/authoring_development/using_php.html)
and [CGI](http://www.pair.com/support/knowledge_base/authoring_development/system_cgi_php-cgiwrap.html),
but not much about `mod_php`. I was able to run a PHP script as CGI, by adding a
`#!/usr/www/cgi-bin/php5.cgi` shebang on the first line, but I didn't want to do
that to every PHP file.

I tried copying `/usr/www/cgi-bin/php5.cgi` into my local `cgi-bin/` directory,
as pair suggests when using cgiwrap, but that again just led to CGI instead of
`mod_php`. I tried lots of variations of this in my `.htaccess`:

```
Action application/php /cgi-sys/php5.cgi
AddType application/php .php
```

...but no luck. It was only when I happened to read their
[WordPress instructions](http://www.pair.com/support/knowledge_base/authoring_development/tools_of_the_trade_wordpress.html)
and notice that URLs didn't start with `cgi-bin/` that I finally realized I
should move the PHP file outside that directory.
