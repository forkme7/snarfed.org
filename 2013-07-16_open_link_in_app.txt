I've just published a new Android app,
[Open Link in App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.snarfed.android.openinapp).
Ever click on a Facebook or Twitter link on your phone, and it opens in the
browser instead of the native app? Me too. This fixes that.

The Twitter app handles some links automatically, but not others, e.g. anything
on `mobile.twitter.com`. Facebook doesn't even try. Google+ is the model
citizen; it handles all of its links correctly, so I didn't need to do anything
for it.

I'll add more apps and link types as I come across them. Feel free to
[ask for](/about) any specific ones you want. Even better, the
[source is on GitHub](https://github.com/snarfed/open-in-app), and I happily
accept pull requests.

Enjoy!
