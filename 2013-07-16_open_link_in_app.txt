I've just published a new Android app,
[Open Link in App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.snarfed.android.openinapp).
Ever tap on a link on your phone and it opens in the browser instead of the
native app? Me too. This fixes that. It currently supports Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, GitHub, and Goodreads.

To use it, after you tap on a link, select _Open Link in App_ from the chooser
dialog box. If you don't see the dialog box, but you think you should, go to
_Settings => Apps => Browser_ or _Chrome_, or whichever app is currently
handling the link, and click _Clear defaults_.

I'll add more apps and link types as I come across them. Feel free to
[ask for](/about) any specific ones you want. Even better, the
[source is on GitHub](https://github.com/snarfed/open-in-app), and I happily
accept pull requests.

Enjoy!
