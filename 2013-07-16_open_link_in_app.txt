I've just published a new Android app,
[Open Link in App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.snarfed.android.openinapp).
Ever click on a Facebook or Twitter link on your phone, and it opens in the
browser instead of the native app? Me too. This fixes that.

To use it, after you click on a Facebook or Twitter link, just select Open Link
in App from the chooser dialog box. If you don't see the dialog box, but you
think you should, go to _Settings => Apps => Browser_ or _Chrome_, or whichever
app is handling the link, and click _Clear defaults_.

By default, the Twitter app handles some links automatically, but not others,
e.g. `mobile.twitter.com` links. This app fills in those gaps. The Facebook app
doesn't handle any links, so this app tries to handle all of them. Many others
apps, e.g. Google+, handle all of their links correctly, so I didn't need to do
anything for them.

I'll add more apps and link types as I come across them. Feel free to
[ask for](/about) any specific ones you want. Even better, the
[source is on GitHub](https://github.com/snarfed/open-in-app), and I happily
accept pull requests.

Enjoy!
