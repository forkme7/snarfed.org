I've just published [activitystreams-unofficial](https://github.com/snarfed/activitystreams-unofficial), a stand-in [ActivityStreams](http://activitystrea.ms/) server for major sites that don't implement it themselves. It currently has implementations for Facebook and Twitter, deployed at these endpoints:

<style type="text/css">
ul { list-style: none; }
</style>

  * [`facebook-activitystreams.appspot.com`](https://facebook-activitystreams.appspot.com/)
  * [`twitter-activitystreams.appspot.com`](https://twitter-activitystreams.appspot.com/)

This complements the unofficial [WebFinger](/2012-01-16_webfinger_for_facebook_and_twitter) and [PortableContacts](/2012-02-22_portablecontacts_for_facebook_and_twitter) providers I published recently. I've updated the [WebFinger provider](/2012-01-16_webfinger_for_facebook_and_twitter) to include `Link` elements pointing to these new ActivityStreams endpoints.

They're all just little side projects, and may not be hugely useful on their own, but together they're another step toward implementing [OStatus bridge apps](/2011-07-27_facebook_app_for_ostatus) for more of the major social networking sites.

Feedback and pull requests are welcome!
