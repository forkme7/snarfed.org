I went to
[Planet Granite](http://www.planetgranite.com/)
[in the Presidio](http://www.planetgranite.com/locations/sanfrancisco/sf_hoursanddirections.php)
last Sunday to go indoor rock climbing with 
[Cynthia](http://originalcynk.com/blog/),
[Clara](http://www.thefacebookera.com/about.php), and
[Dan](http://www.facebook.com/daniel.s.chao).
I'd done some light climbing a few times before, but apart from
[a short session](2006-06-09_high_adventure) at the
[Stanford climbing gym](http://climbing.stanford.edu/),
this was the first time I'd ever done anything serious.

The safety procedures for climbing and belaying aren't too involved, but I still
needed a refresher course, which Dan was happy to provide. He prepared me more
than enough for the quick, hands-on safety exam in the gym. $24 later, I was
harnessed, tied in, clipped on, and climbing up a wall!

I have to admit, I didn't enjoy that first route much. I'd learned to tie knots
and handle carabiners, but I didn't really know how to climb, so I had to learn
on the job, which wasn't very fun. On top of that, climbing wasn't the aerobic
or restistance workout I'd hoped for, but my fingers and toes did complain
bitterly at the abuse. To top it all off, the height gave me solid dose of
vertigo.

I managed, though, and I saw how I _could_ enjoy it, even if I wasn't actually
enjoying it quite yet. I belayed Dan while he climbed, then tried another route.
And another. It eventually came together, and before long I was having a great
time.

By the end of the day, I'd climbed routes
[rated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_%28climbing%29#YDS_Class)
from 5.7 up to 5.10a, which I was happy with. I even managed to
["send"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_climbing_terms#Send)
a few of the 5.9s, ie climb them without falling or weighting the rope. I
fell off the 5.10a once, but I climbed back on and made it to the top without
falling again.

It was a lot of fun. It never really turned into a workout comparable to
[running](2006-02-01_running_maps) or lifting, and my fingers did turn
into claws for a while, but it was worth it. I started to get a feel my center
of gravity, and I learned a few interesting moves and techniques, enough to make
me look forward to trying again next week. See you on the wall!
