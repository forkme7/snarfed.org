I recently upgraded from [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com/) [Lucid](https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/about-ubuntu/C/) (10.04) to [Precise](https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-help/) (12.04). Similar to my list of [tips for Lucid](/ubuntu_lucid) [and Fedora Core 3](/fedora_core_3_on_vmware), here are some tips for Ubuntu Precise. (I'm running it on a [Thinkpad X201](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/landing_pages/thinkpad/2010/X201-X201s-X201tablet)).

  * I used to use `xmodmap` to swap the Caps Lock and left Control keys, but no longer. It's evidently deprecated, and `setxkbmap` is now X.org's preferred way to manipulate keymaps. This does the trick:

    ```
    setxkbmap -option ctrl:swapcaps
    ```

  * I used to use `aumix` as my volume control and mixer, but it
couldn't find the mixer device in Precise. I could have dug around for it, but
instead I just switched to `amixer`, which works fine.

    ...except that toggling mute with `amixer ... toggle` mutes ok but doesn't
unmute! A bit of investigation found that `toggle` mutes a bunch of channels,
including (for me) Master, Headphone, PCM, and Front, but only unmutes the
channel you tell it to toggle. Details in the
[bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/878986)
and these
[askubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/65764/how-do-i-toggle-sound-with-amixer)
[questions](http://askubuntu.com/questions/118675/mute-key-mutes-alsa-and-pulseaudio-but-unmutes-only-alsa).
The solution is to toggle all of the channels explicitly:

    ```
    echo 'sset Master toggle
     sset Headphone toggle
     sset PCM toggle
     sset Front toggle' | amixer --stdin -q
    ```

  * On the topic of sound, it didn't initially work on my laptop because
    `/dev/snd/*` weren't world writable or readable. A quick
    `sudo chmod a+rw /dev/snd/*` fixed that, but it didn't stick across
    reboots, so I put it in my `.login`. Oddly, my workstation didn't have this
    permissions problem; it worked out of the box.

  * Precise's [NetworkManager](http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/)
    package added
    [`nmcli`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/nmcli.1.html) and
    [`nm-tool`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/nm-tool.1.html),
    two great command line tools. No more clunky
    [cnetworkmanager](http://vidner.net/martin/software/cnetworkmanager/)! I
    also hacked the status bar in [notion](http://notion.sourceforge.net/) (n√©e
    [ion3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_(window_manager))), my window
    manager, to use them to find the current network connection:

    ```
    nmcli -terse -field devices,name,state con status \
      | sed -r "s/activated/\*/; s/activating/.../; s/deactivated/X/; s/:/ /g"
    ```

    and Wifi signal strength:

    ```
    nm-tool | grep \*`nmcli -t -f name con status` \
        | egrep -o "Strength [0-9]+" \
        | cut -d" " -f2-
    ```

  * It's not Precise-specific, but these AIM notifications have always annoyed
    me: _AOL System Msg: Your screen name (mrEman) is now signed into AOL(R)
    Instant Messenger (TM) in 2 locations._ I use Pidgin, so I finally looked
    around and found
    [this plugin](http://biodegradablegeek.com/2009/05/how-to-block-aims-annoying-aol-system-msg-in-pidgin/),
    which happily blocks them.

  * The font in Emacs changed, and it took me a while to figure out how to
    change it back. None of the usual methods (`.Xresources`,
    `set-default-font`) worked. I finally re-read the
    [Fonts section](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Fonts.html)
    of the manual and saw that the X resource is now `emacs.font`, not
    `Emacs*font`, which I've had in my `.Xresources` forever, but that still didn't
    fix it.

    I finally figured out that `--daemon` in Emacs 23.3 now ignores anything
    related to windowing systems, including fonts. I have to run
    `(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "7x14")` in Emacs _after_ X is
    running. Sigh, oh well.

  * Is
    [polkitd](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/polkitd.8.html)
    pegging your CPU and eating all of your RAM? Try
    [restarting the DBUS daemon](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/39203/how-to-restart-polkitd)
    with `sudo service dbus restart`.

  * Here are some of the extra packages I installed:

    * apache2
    * apel
    * autocutsel
    * colordiff
    * emacs-goodies-el
    * emacs23-el
    * emacs23-lucid
    * exif
    * fbreader
    * flashplugin-installer
    * flickcurl-utils
    * gcalcli
    * git
    * imagemagick
    * imagemagick-doc
    * jnettop
    * lua-mode
    * lynx
    * mercurial
    * mercurial-git
    * mpg123
    * mplayer
    * mysql-client
    * mysql-server
    * php-elisp
    * php5
    * php5-cgi
    * php5-cli
    * php5-curl
    * php5-mysql

    * python-mysqldb
    * rxvt-unicode
    * sshfs
    * sysfsutils
    * tkcvs

    * udev
    * usbmount
    * xloadimage
    * xkbset
    * xscreensaver
    * xsltproc
    * yaml-mode

    ...and I needed these to build [notion](http://notion.sourceforge.net/), my
    window manager:

    * gettext
    * liblua5.1-0-dev
    * libsm-dev
    * libx11-dev
    * libxext-dev
    * libxinerama-dev
    * libxrandr-dev


Enjoy Ubuntu Precise!
