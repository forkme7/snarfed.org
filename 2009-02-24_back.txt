We're back up! Sorry for the inconvenience, and thanks for your patience.

What happened? In short, my [hosting provider](http://pair.com/) disabled my
[PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/) CGI script, which
<strike>runs</strike> used to run this site. It was using too much CPU on my
server ([ambym](http://ambym.pair.com/)) for sustained periods of time, due to a
combination of [comment and referrer spam](/referrer_spam) storms and
[inefficient](http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/registry/input/comments/comments.html)
[plugins](/pyblosxom_history), and it was impacting other sites. I may not have
liked that they turned me off, but it was only reasonable.

In the short term, I blocked a bunch of spammer IP addresses and optimized the
[comments](http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/registry/input/comments/comments.html)
and [history](/pyblosxom_history) plugins. In the long term, I'd love to
use either [FastCGI](http://fastcgi.com/) or [WSGI](http://wsgi.org/wsgi/) to avoid
the cost of starting up the python interpreter, loading all of the modules, and
initializing PyBlosxom on every single request. Unfortunately,
[pair](http://pair.com/) doesn't support them on
[shared accounts](http://www.pair.com/services/web_hosting/). Sigh.
