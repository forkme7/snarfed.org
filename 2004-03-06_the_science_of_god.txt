This week's Economist has an
[article](http://www.economist.com/node/2478148)
on how we experience religion and spirituality. Neurology researchers in Canada
have been using brain imaging techniques to study the brains of Carmelite nuns.
This has helped them understand what happens in our brains when we pray or
experience spiritual events.

Between God and love, we don't have many mysteries left!
