Video from Google I/O Talk

The [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOgpXECblk)
of my talk at Google I/O this year,
[Transactions Across Datacenters (and other weekend projects)](http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/TransactionsAcrossDatacenters.html),
is up!

I give [talks every now and then](/talks), and many of them are recorded,
so normally, this wouldn't be a big deal. Not many of them
[publish the videos on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOgpXECblk),
though, so that's exciting. Plus, I put a little more effort into this one than
usual, and
[just like last year's](http://sites.google.com/site/io/under-the-covers-of-the-google-app-engine-datastore),
I had a lot of fun presenting it.

Enjoy!
