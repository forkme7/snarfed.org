It's been over a year since I last compiled usage statistics for
[Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy/),
[our](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/graphs/contributors) little
[IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) side project, and
[IndieWebCamp SF last week](https://indiewebcamp.com/2015/SF) was good
motivation to update them. Here they are!

The trends patterns are broadly the same as last year, so I won't belabor the
obvious. A few high level notes:

* I *think* user growth is roughly linear, not polynomial or exponential, but
it's hard to say. It looks like it's a bunch of small asymptotic curves, each
one started by a PR boost somewhere or other. In any case, we're adding ~150
users per month right now.
* Response and webmention volume, on the other hand, seem to be at least
superlinear if not exponential.
* [Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publish) usage has surpassed
[blog webmentions](https://www.brid.gy/about#blogs), even
despite [my recent publish misgivings](/2015-11-29_keep-bridgy-publish-dumb).
Having said that...
* ...listen (aka backfeed) is still comfortably the most popular feature.
* Twitter and Facebook are still comfortably the most popular silos.
* Based on very rough, back of the envelope math, Bridgy costs about
$0.02/user/month to run right now. That's all kinds of oversimplified, of
course - most of that is for listen, not publish or blog webmentions, and most
of *that* is for active users, since we only poll inactive users once a
day - but still, assuming the distributions don't change too much, it may still
be useful for capacity planning.
