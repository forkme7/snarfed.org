It's been over a year since I
[last compiled usage statistics](/2014-11-06_happy-1000th-bridgy)
for [Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy/),
[our](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/graphs/contributors) little
[IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) side project, and
[IndieWebCamp SF last week](https://indiewebcamp.com/2015/SF) was good
motivation to update them. Here they are!

The patterns are broadly the same as last year, so I won't belabor the obvious.
A few high level thoughts:

<!-- more -->
<span />

* I *think* user growth is roughly linear, not polynomial or exponential, but
it's hard to say. It looks like it's a bunch of small asymptotic curves, each
one started by a PR boost somewhere or other. In any case, we're adding ~150
users per month right now.
* Response and webmention volume, on the other hand, seem to be at least
superlinear, if not exponential.
* [Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publish) usage has surpassed
[blog webmentions](https://www.brid.gy/about#blogs), even
despite [my recent misgivings](/2015-11-29_keep-bridgy-publish-dumb).
* Having said that, listen (aka backfeed) is still comfortably the most popular
feature.
* Twitter and Facebook are still comfortably the most popular silos.
* Bridgy costs about $0.02/user/month to run right now. That's all kinds of
oversimplified, of course - most of that is for listen, not publish or blog
webmentions, and most of *that* is for active users, since we only poll inactive
users once a day - but still, assuming those ratios don't change too much, it's
still useful for capacity planning.

Methodology for generating the stats: download Bridgy's latest
[datastore backup](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy#misc), run
[`to_tsv.py`](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/blob/master/scripts/to_tsv.py)
on it, import the output file into
[this public spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VhGiZ9Z9PEl7f9ciiVZZgupNcUTsRVltQ8_CqFETpfU/edit),
and use it to generate the graphs.
