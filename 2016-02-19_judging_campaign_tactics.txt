Donald Trump.

Admit it, you have half a lather worked up already. The man is incendiary; the
campaign is astounding. He's built a big base of support with tactics that we
thought were off the table entirely and should have sunk him long ago.

What changed? Do we not have the grasp on campaign tactics we thought we did? Do
we need to dive back into modern electioneering, break it down, and really
understand it piece by piece if we want to get the leaders we *think* we're
electing?

Campaigning today is a complicated business.
[Fundraising](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/election-2016-campaign-money-race.html),
[optics](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/magazine/07FOB-onlanguage-t.html),
[opposition research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_research),
[social media](http://recode.net/2016/01/27/meet-donald-trumps-twitter-whisperer/)...there's
a lot to it, all far removed from the actual task of governing and policy
making. (You may still spend much of your time fundraising and campaigning once
you're in office, but that's a different issue.)

The founding idea of democracy is that citizens choose their representatives
directly. For that to work, they need a clear picture of who each candidate is,
what they stand for, and how they'd govern. So as a society, we'd ideally judge
campaign tactics based on how well they describe a candidate. Facebook post on
Alice's home town? OK. Deceptive attack ad that lies about Bob's voting record?
Not OK.

Many common campaign tactics fail that test. We may not have large
[scale voter fraud](https://snarfed.org/2007-12-01_windsurfing_in_venezuela#comment-164),
but we do have
[personal attacks](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/us/politics/donald-trump-gets-personal-in-attacks-on-ted-cruz-at-tea-party-convention.html),
smears,
[undercover stings](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/abortion-planned-parenthood-sting-videos-david-daleiden-121747),
and recently the rise of the
["personal fact."](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/22/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-thousands-new-jersey-ch/)
[Social media targeting](http://recode.net/2016/01/27/meet-donald-trumps-twitter-whisperer/)
and [astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing) may be milder,
but still misleading. Swinging right (or left) for the primary and back to
center for the general is so common,
[we expect all candidates to do it](http://themonkeycage.org/Abramowitz.Primary.Voters.pdf).

We've had a bit of success outlawing and discouraging some of these tactics.
Campaign funding reform has made some progress,
*[Citizens United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC)*
notwithstanding. Candidates routinely promise not to take money
[from certain groups](http://www.hannity.com/articles/election-493995/bernie-sanders-may-have-just-made-14046354/)
([or anyone](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-self-funding-his-campaign-sort/))
and not to "go negative" and attack their opponents directly.
[Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/) has built a business determining
whether campaign statements are true or
[pants-on-fire false](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/rulings/pants-fire/).

That's all well and good, but bad tactics persist. If we can't prevent them,
should we take them into account when we vote? Most candidates probably believe
campaign tactics are for campaigns, and wouldn't inform how they'd govern, but
I'm not convinced. We routinely see elected officials
[smear opponents like WikiLeaks's Julian Assange](http://www.fastcompany.com/1707146/anatomy-smear-wikileaks-assange-wanted-sex-surprise-not-rape),
for example.

Many candidates rationalize bad campaign tactics by saying the ends justify the
means. "I'll do good once I'm in office, so if I step on a few toes to get
there, it's worth it." Utilitarian ethics and philosophy are beyond the reach of
this little essay, but I will say that actions speak louder than words. If "ends
justify the means" appeals to a candidate during a campaign, it will appeal to
them afterward too, and next time those toes might be chests, or necks.

Predicting the future is hard, even if you're creating it. If you don't get
elected - and you probably won't! - it's a lot harder to justify hurting people
along the way. I constantly have to remind myself of this [at work](/resume).
It's so tempting to add just one more thing to a product or codebase because I'm
sure I'll need it down the road, but I often don't, and then I'm stuck with the
extra complexity for no benefit.

There's also the character question. It's clearly unacceptable to
[call Megyn Kelly a bimbo](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-megyn-kelly-bimbo-tweet)
or
[characterize Mexicans as rapists and criminals](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/),
full stop. Even if Trump might not do that kind of thing as President, is it a
sign of the policies he'd pursue? How about the more abstract notions of
character, integrity, and values?

Politicians' personal lives have only been fair game in the press for half a
century, or so, at least in the US, and it took another few decades for the
[Clinton/Lewinsky scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewinsky_scandal)
[and impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_and_acquittal_of_Bill_Clinton)
to ask whether politicians can compartmentalize private lives and public
responsibilities. We're still figuring out how we feel about all this,
campaign tactics included.

In the end, the "clear description" test might be the best measuring stick.
Democracy needs voters to understand what each candidate stands for and how
they'd govern. Fundraising and opposition research may make us squirm, but they
don't necessarily mislead the electorate. Smears,
[personal facts](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-we-should-choose-science-over-beliefs/), and
[changing positions](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/will-the-real-donald-trump-please-stand-up-120607)
[to suit polls](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/07/28/426888268/donald-trumps-flipping-political-donations)
do. We shouldn't stand for them, and we shouldn't vote for candidates who do.
