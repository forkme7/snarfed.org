Mustache Competition

During the month of May 2005, a group of us competed to see who could grow the best mustache. Some of you may be thinking, "...but Ryan grows facial hair like a 12-year-old girl!" Well, you're right, of course, but I wasn't about to give up without a fight.

No one actually wants a mustache for any length of time, so we grew full-on beards. At the end of the month, we broke out the razors, posted lookouts to watch for the fashion police, and hit the runway to strut our stuff.

It may have be a foregone conclusion, but we never actually formally decided the winner. We originally planned to hold a vote, open to the general public. The ballot box was going to be built along the lines of this [prototype](http://neugierig.org/software/vote/demo/ranking/)...but we never got around to it. Props to [Evan Martin](http://neugierig.org/) for the prototype, though!

Here are before and after pictures, as well as some candids and group shots from the final judging and awards ceremony.
