...but I can still type

Last Tuesday, on the way up to SF aboard the fabulous [Google
shuttle](http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/09/worth-drive_13.html), I
somehow managed to fracture my hand. It's a long story, but suffice it to say
that I'm no match for a heavy roof hatch, some sharp corners, and the air
pressure outside a bus going 70mph.

Of course, it's possible that every bone in my hand is completely shattered. Or
maybe it's perfectly fine, and I'm imagining the whole thing. Who knows? I went
to the hospital on Wednesday, and I _still_ haven't heard the results of the
x-ray. An x-ray taken _four days ago_. It really amuses me that the [Stanford
Medical Group](http://smg.stanford.edu) provides paperless offices, [online
access to doctors](http://www.relayhealth.com/rh/defaultNoFlash.aspx), and even
a [hospital blog](http://www.stanford.edu/~pmford/blog/), but they take 3-5
business days to read x-rays.

...but at least my doctor has [her own web
site](http://smg.stanford.edu/faculty/cohen.html), right?
