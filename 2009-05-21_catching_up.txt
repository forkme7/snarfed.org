Catching up

Real life tends to get in the way of updating this site. That's not the worst
problem in the world, but when I do find free time, it's always nice to share
whatever's been keeping me busy. Here are a few highlights from the past
couple months!

Despite its hipster aesthetic, [This American Life](http://www.thislife.org/)
is one of my [favorite radio shows](/podcasts). It's quirky, compelling,
and utterly human. You can imagine how excited I was when I heard about their
[live show](http://www.thislife.org/About_TALLive.aspx), recorded in front of
a studio audience at the [Chicago Theatre](http://www.thechicagotheatre.com/)
and broadcast in realtime to movie theaters across the country.

The original event sold out immediately, but
[Jon](http://dr-nuk.livejournal.com/),
[Vanessa](http://vanessaart.com/),
and I managed to grab tickets to the encore performance. It was a blast.
Seeing the speakers added another dimension to the experience, without
detracting from the stories themselves. They also took advantage of the
extended format with video and animated shorts, as well as unscripted, behind
the scenes commentary that made the show feel even more intimate. We loved
it.

The week after that, [Cynthia](http://originalcynk.com/blog/) and I caught
hometown bluegrass legend
[Toshio Hirano](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Toshio-Hirano/34312993358)
at his usual Monday night stomping grounds,
[Amnesia](http://www.amnesiathebar.com/), in the Mission. He's been a regular
there for years, belting out rough-hewn, heartfelt American folk ballads in
his signature Japanese accent. It's surreal, to be sure, but he's so earnest -
and so good! - that you can't help but enjoy it.


Before Amnesia, on a whim, we grabbed dinner at
[Beretta](http://vanessaart.com/), and...damn. It may have been partly because we
weren't expecting much, but I haven't been that pleasantly surprised by a
restaurant in a long time. The pizza was the main event, but the eggplant
caponatina and the polenta stole the show. Not to mention I found two new
varietals, Primitivo and Negroamaro, that I love. Too bad you missed it,
[Nathan](http://www.nathanstoll.com/blog/)!
