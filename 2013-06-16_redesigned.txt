Redesigned

It's been [almost 10 years](/2003-06-29_blogtastic) since I started this web
site, and modulo a few tweaks, it's looked basically the same way it did at the
beginning...

...until now. It's been a great ride, and I'm glad the design held up this long,
but the web has moved on: high res images, infinite scroll, responsive design,
symbol fonts. It's high time for a redesign...and here it is! It's based on the
[Ryu WordPress theme](http://wordpress.org/themes/ryu), with a full bleed header
and a lot of custom CSS.

I'm still debugging, but I think it's going to work out. Let me know what you
think!
