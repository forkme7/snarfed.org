Gmail vs. Pine

I've used [Pine](http://washington.edu/pine/) as my email client for, well,
pretty much forever. I use it because it's fast, powerful, stable, and very
keyboardable. (I _hate_ the mouse.)

However, since I work at [Google](http://google.com/), I'm constantly bombarded
with people who ask me why I don't use [Gmail](http://gmail.com/). After hearing
the nth person brag about how much it increased their productivity, I finally
broke down and tried it. I didn't expect much, since I've never liked web-based
email clients. However, I made myself use it as my _only_ email client, for a
month, to give it a fair shot.
