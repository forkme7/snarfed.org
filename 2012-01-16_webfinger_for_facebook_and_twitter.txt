I've just published [webfinger-unofficial](https://github.com/snarfed/webfinger-unofficial), a stand-in [WebFinger](http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/) server for major sites that don't implement it themselves. It currently has implementations for Facebook and Twitter, deployed at these endpoints:

<style type="text/css">
ul {
  font-size: large;
  list-style: none;
}
</style>

  * [`facebook-webfinger.appspot.com`](http://facebook-webfinger.appspot.com/)
  * [`twitter-webfinger.appspot.com`](http://twitter-webfinger.appspot.com/)

It's just a little side project, and it's not hugely useful on its own, but it is a step toward implementing [OStatus bridge apps](/2011-07-27_facebook_app_for_ostatus) for more of the major social networking sites.

Feedback and pull requests are welcome!
