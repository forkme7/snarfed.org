* Atom with AS1, PoCo extensions.
* PuSH. superfeedr can do free. but need account? so do it ourselves?
* convert representative h-card to webfinger with links to Atom, homepage, salmon endpoint, magic key
* salmon <=> webmentions
  need to inject our webmention endpoint into ostatus site? unlikely, but could try. add to https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/1384
* no user login needed! can handle any user. just need XXX for indieweb sites, rel-webmention for ostatus projects.

Mastodon issue:
add external webmention endpoint?
...
this would be a substantial project, so i definitely understand that it isn't a priority for you all.

if there was a third party service that converted webmentions to/from Salmon slaps, and you just had to add a `<link>` to your HTML pointing to it, would you consider that instead? something like:

```
<link rel="webmention" href="https://ostatus.brid.gy/webmention">
```

I've built a similar service that bridges social networks with webmentions, https://brid.gy/ , which has been running since Jan 2012 and scaled a fair amount. I'd love to build a similar bridge between OStatus (including Mastodon) and webmentions. i could do it without this `<link>` on your side if i wrap/proxy all Mastodon user addresses and pages on my bridge, but I'd much rather use Mastodon user addresses and pages directly, since that would obviously be better UX.

this would enable rich federation with indieweb site, including replies, likes, mentions, etc. my track record with https://brid.gy/ is evidence that i can build and run this bridge reliably long term, but you'd obviously be free to remove the link if i ever take down my bridge.

thanks in advance!
