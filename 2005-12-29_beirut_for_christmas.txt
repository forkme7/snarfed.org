Beirut for Christmas

Merry Christmas, everyone! I don't know what turned up under your tree this
year, but for my money, [Joel](http://joelonsoftware.com/) and the [Fog
Creek](http://fogcreek.com/) [Copilot](https://www.copilot.com/) team may have
the best Christmas present ever.

I present to you..._drum roll_...the [beerpong
table](http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/12/14b.html)!

Genius. Absolute genius. Now they just need to build them in bulk. I'd be the
first in line to buy one for Pi Kappa Nu.
