Over the last couple weeks of vacation, we've wandered all over Scotland,
Ireland, and the Channel Islands. It's been great! Next up is a wedding at
[Highclere Castle](http://www.highclerecastle.co.uk/), then we head back to the
states, but I'm going ahead and posting the pictures we have so far now.

We did it on a cruise, which was interestingly clich√©d enough that
[I wrote a lightly philosophical post on it](https://snarfed.org/2013-05-26_cruise).
