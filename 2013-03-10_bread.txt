Fun exchange this morning with the manager at
[Tyger's](https://plus.google.com/108138505070916147693),
where I go for breakfast now and then.

I order my usual: one of the omelettes, whichever looks good, hold the
toast.

Manager: OK! [pause.] So I'm curious...you don't eat bread?

Me: Hah, no, I do sometimes, just not often.

Manager: Ah, I see. Lots of other people are like that now too. No bread for
them!

Me: Yeah, I'm not surprised. We used to think fat was bad for us, but now it's
looking like sugar and wheat are actually the bad parts.

Manager: Yeah, ok. Everyone wants to be skinny. [Looks me up and down.] But you,
no belly, you need to eat bread! I'm bringing you toast right now.
