Comments R Us

snarfed.org is still being polished, so I'm experimenting. You may have noticed
that you can now comment on things. Comments are good! Further, I think they'll
encourage a community atmosphere on snarfed.org.

Originally I disabled comments, because they made the pages more cluttered, and
my personal design aesthetic is very minimalist. After reconsidering, though,
this site is more about community than design. If comments help foster
community, then that's just plain more important.

So, I'm putting my theory to the test. Write a comment!

(Yeah, you have to register, but I have a better privacy policy than any big
commercial site. If I ever give away \*any\* of your information, you get to
poke me in the butt with a pitchfork. Repeatedly. Youch!!!)
