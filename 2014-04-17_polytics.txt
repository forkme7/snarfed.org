Stop me if you've heard this one. When the last presidential campaign rolled
around, Barack Obama wasn't excited about business as usual. Instead, his
campaign
[hired a bunch of smart techies](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/magazine/the-obama-campaigns-digital-masterminds-cash-in.html),
whipped volunteer and donor databases into shape,
[mined big data from them](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/10/harper-reed-obama-campaign-microtargeting)
until they cried uncle, raised more money _and_ mobilized more volunteers than
any candidate ever before, and coasted to victory while reporters fawned over
his Internet savvy and hard-nosed nunber crunching.

How about this one? The country's position on gay marriage has shifted pretty
steadily over even just the last few years. Obama was officially against it
during the last campaign, but he famously
[changed his mind](http://www.cnet.com/news/obamas-same-sex-marriage-tweet-goes-viral/)
a couple years ago. His opponents seized the opportunity to
[label him a "flip-flopper"](http://nation.foxnews.com/president-obama/2012/05/09/obama-reverses-position-same-sex-marriage),
implying that he was inauthentic and didn't stand up for his beliefs.

The Internet has hit politics in a big way. Reporters fawn over Obama,
[MoveOn.org](http://moveon.org/), and other groups for using social media and
data mining to mobilize - and react to - both volunteers and voters. At the same
time, legislators cry foul over
[gotcha journalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotcha_journalism),
[ballot-box budgeting](http://ballotpedia.org/History_of_Initiative_and_Referendum_in_California#.22Ballot-box_budgeting.22),
and paper-thin politicians who change their positions at the
[slightest breeze of](http://www.change.org/) likes and retweets.

The criticisms resonate with me. We already worry that our politicians are
[gridlocked, inauthentic, and don't follow through on their promises](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163031/gridlock-top-reason-americans-critical-congress.aspx).
A/B testing and instant online feedback seem to make all this even worse.

I wonder, though. The whole point of representative democracy is for our elected
officials to *represent* us, to make laws and interact with other officials in
the ways we want. Historically, we've had only had a handful of tools for this:
the heavy election sledgehammer, the press grenade we can't hope to aim
effectively, opinion polls no more accurate than bent, rusty nails, and a few
tiny glasses screwdrivers like letters, phone calls, town hall meetings. They
get the job done, but they're not great.

As it has in most other fields, technology can clearly help. Online petitions
and polls and micro-elections, direct communication over social media, and
instantaneous, 24/7 press cycles now give politicians a continuous stream of
feedback from their constituents. Groups like XXX praise this

I don't know if they're changing positions
more often as a result, like Obama famously did over gay marriage, but if so, is
that so bad? Better late than never, right? If you supported gay marriage before
Obama, aren't you glad he come around eventually, instead of holding firm
because, say, he had a weak sense of public opinion - or worse, to avoid being
accused of waffling?

Here's one key question: what if Obama didn't actually change his mind at all?
What if he just changed his public position based on the polls? If he now
consistently supports gay marriage and votes for it, does it matter whether he
personally agrees with it or not? If so, how much does it matter?

The knee jerk reaction is, of course it matters! But I don't know. If his public
actions are indistinguishable, then arguably it doesn't matter at all.

Of course, that's pretty unlikely. In reality, your personal belief on an issue
is a big part of what motivates you to work hard and fight for it, or against
it. In practice, actually believing will get better results.

Having said that, most politicians' single biggest desire probably isn't an
issue at all, but just to get re-elected. Modern technology lets them take our
pulse faster, cheaper, and better than ever before. If that helps them hew more
closely toward our desires so they can win elections, so much the better.

As usual, the conclusion here isn't that technology is inherently good or bad
for politics, but just that it
[amplifies and accelerates the political results we already want](/2012-08-13_technology_makes_us_more_who_we_are).
I think that actually _is_ inherently good, though, at least a bit.
Representative democracy is all about helping us get what we want out of
government. If technology helps, so much the better! It may not solve the money
problem, or gridlock or the media echo chamber or any number of other problems,
but I'll take what I can get.
