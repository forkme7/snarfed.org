Stop me if you've heard this one. When the last presidential campaign rolled
around, Barack Obama wasn't excited about business as usual. Instead, his
campaign
[hired a bunch of smart techies](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/magazine/the-obama-campaigns-digital-masterminds-cash-in.html),
whipped databases into shape and
[mined them until they cried uncle](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/10/harper-reed-obama-campaign-microtargeting),
raised more money and mobilized more volunteers than ever before, and coasted
to victory while reporters fawned over his Internet savvy and hard-nosed number
crunching.

Oh, you've heard it? How about this one: Obama was originally against gay
marriage, but he famously
[changed his mind](http://www.cnet.com/news/obamas-same-sex-marriage-tweet-goes-viral/)
a couple years ago when public support gained critical mass. His opponents
seized the opportunity to
[label him a "flip-flopper"](http://nation.foxnews.com/president-obama/2012/05/09/obama-reverses-position-same-sex-marriage),
implying that he didn't stand up for his beliefs.

I think they're both symptoms of the same thing: the Internet. We all get
excited that Obama, [MoveOn.org](http://moveon.org/), and other groups use
social media and big data to mobilize and react to voters, volunteers, and
donors. At the same time, legislators cry foul over
[gotcha journalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotcha_journalism),
[ballot-box budgeting](http://ballotpedia.org/History_of_Initiative_and_Referendum_in_California#.22Ballot-box_budgeting.22),
and paper-thin politicians who change their positions
[at the slightest breeze](http://www.change.org/) of likes and retweets.

The criticisms resonate with me. We already worry that our politicians are
[gridlocked, inauthentic, and don't follow through on their promises](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163031/gridlock-top-reason-americans-critical-congress.aspx).
A/B testing and instant online feedback will make this even worse, right?

I wonder. The whole point of representative democracy is for our elected
officials to *represent* us, to make laws and interact with other officials in
the ways we want. Historically, we've had only had a handful of tools for this:
the heavy sledgehammer of elections, the press grenade we can't hope to aim,
opinion polls about as accurate as rusted-out nails, and finally the tiny
glasses screwdrivers: letters, phone calls, and town hall meetings with actual
constituents. These tools may get the job done, but they're not great.

Technology can clearly help. Online petitions and micro-elections, direct
communication over social media, and instantaneous, 24/7 press cycles now give
politicians a continuous stream of feedback. Groups like
[Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/),
[Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/), and [GovHack](http://www.govhack.org/) praise
this new world of empowered citizens. They're usually silent on the drawbacks,
though, such as flip-flopping.

Take Obama's gay marriage reversal. I don't know if modern politicians change
their minds more often due to technology, but if they do, would that be so bad?
Say you supported gay marriage before Obama did. Aren't you glad he come around
eventually, instead of holding firm due to outdated public opinion polls - or
worse, to avoid being accused of waffling?

Here's a question: what if Obama didn't actually change his mind at all? What if
he changed his public position, but still personally opposed gay marriage? Would
it matter whether he supported it in private or not, as long as he consistently
supported it _in public_ and voted for it?

The knee jerk reaction is, of course it would matter! But I don't know. If his
public actions were indistinguishable, then arguably it wouldn't matter at all.
Of course, that's pretty unlikely. In reality, your personal beliefs motivate
you to work hard and fight for what you believe in. Caring begets results.

Realistically though, most politicians care about getting re-elected more than
any single issue. Modern technology lets them take our pulse faster, cheaper,
and better than ever before. If that helps them hew more closely toward _our_
desires so they can win elections, so much the better.

As usual, the conclusion isn't that technology is inherently good or bad for
politics, but that it
[amplifies and accelerates what we already want](/2012-08-13_technology_makes_us_more_who_we_are).
In this case, though, I think that _is_ inherently good. Representative
democracy is all about getting us the government we want. If technology helps,
so much the better! It may not solve the money part, or the gridlock or media
echo chamber or any number of other problems, but I'll take what I can get.

(Of course, that begs the question: is the government we want actually the
government that's best for us?
[I'm not convinced.](/2012-03-25_how_should_groups_make_decisions) But that's a
post for another day...)
