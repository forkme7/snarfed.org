Stop me if you've heard this one. When the last presidential campaign rolled
around, Barack Obama wasn't excited about business as usual. Instead, his
campaign
[hired a bunch of smart techies](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/magazine/the-obama-campaigns-digital-masterminds-cash-in.html),
whipped databases into shape and
[mined them until they cried uncle](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/10/harper-reed-obama-campaign-microtargeting),
raised more money _and_ mobilized more volunteers than ever before, and coasted
to victory while reporters fawned over his Internet savvy and hard-nosed number
crunching.

Oh, Obama was originally against gay marriage, but he famously
[changed his mind](http://www.cnet.com/news/obamas-same-sex-marriage-tweet-goes-viral/)
a couple years ago. His opponents seized the opportunity to
[label him a "flip-flopper"](http://nation.foxnews.com/president-obama/2012/05/09/obama-reverses-position-same-sex-marriage),
implying that he was inauthentic and didn't stand up for his beliefs.

I think they're both symptoms of the same thing: the Internet. Reporters fawn
over Obama, [MoveOn.org](http://moveon.org/), and other groups for using social
media and big data to mobilize - and react to - voters, volunteers, and donors.
At the same time, legislators cry foul over
[gotcha journalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotcha_journalism),
[ballot-box budgeting](http://ballotpedia.org/History_of_Initiative_and_Referendum_in_California#.22Ballot-box_budgeting.22),
and paper-thin politicians who change their positions [at the
slightest breeze](http://www.change.org/) of likes and retweets.

The criticisms resonate with me. We already worry that our politicians are
[gridlocked, inauthentic, and don't follow through on their promises](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163031/gridlock-top-reason-americans-critical-congress.aspx).
A/B testing and instant online feedback will make this even worse, right?

I wonder, though. The whole point of representative democracy is for our elected
officials to *represent* us, to make laws and interact with other officials in
the ways we want. Historically, we've had only had a handful of tools for this:
the heavy sledgehammer of elections, the press grenade we can't hope to aim,
opinion polls about as accurate as rusty, bent nails, and finally, the tiny
glasses screwdrivers: letters, phone calls, and town hall meetings with actual
constituents. Combined, these tools do get the job done, but they don't do it
well.

Technology can clearly help. Online petitions and micro-elections, direct
communication over social media, and instantaneous, 24/7 press cycles now give
politicians a continuous stream of feedback from their constituents. Groups like
[Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/),
[Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/), and [GovHack](http://www.govhack.org/) praise
this new world of empowered citizens, but they're usually silent on drawbacks
like flip-flopping because of online uproars.

Take Obama's flip on gay marriage. I don't know if modern politicians are
changing their minds more often, but if they are, would that be so bad? If you
supported gay marriage before Obama did, aren't you glad he come around
eventually, instead of holding firm due to outdated public opinion polls - or
worse, to avoid being accused of waffling?

Here's a question: what if Obama didn't actually change his mind at all? What if
he changed his public position, but still personally opposed gay marriage? If he
consistently supported it _in public_, and voted for it, would it matter whether
he supported it in private or not? If so, how much would it matter?

The knee jerk reaction is, of course it would matter! But I don't know. If his
public actions were indistinguishable, then arguably it wouldn't matter at all.

Of course, that's pretty unlikely. In reality, your personal belief on an issue
is a big part of what motivates you to work hard and fight for it, or against
it. In practice, actually believing will get better results.

Having said that, most politicians' single biggest desire probably isn't an
issue at all, but just to get re-elected. Modern technology lets them take our
pulse faster, cheaper, and better than ever before. If that helps them hew more
closely toward our desires so they can win elections, so much the better.

As usual, the conclusion here isn't that technology is inherently good or bad
for politics, but just that it
[amplifies and accelerates the political results we already want](/2012-08-13_technology_makes_us_more_who_we_are).
I think that actually _is_ inherently good, though, at least a bit.
Representative democracy is all about helping us get what we want out of
government. If technology helps, so much the better! It may not solve the money
problem, or gridlock or the media echo chamber or any number of other problems,
but I'll take what I can get.
