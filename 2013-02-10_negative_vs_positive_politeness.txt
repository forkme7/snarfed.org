> Basically there are two sorts of cultures. In crowded countries such as Japan
> and Britain we tend to have 'negative politeness'. This means that people are
> aware of others' need for privacy, and their desire not to be intruded upon. In
> countries where there is more space, like the USA, people are more inclined to
> practise 'positive politeness', where the emphasis is on inclusion and openness.
> The anthropologist Kate Fox says that what looks like stand-offishness in a
> negative-politeness culture is really a sort of consideration for people's
> privacy.
