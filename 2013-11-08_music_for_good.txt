We went to an awesome concert last weekend. It wasn't a big star, or a big
venue, or a big new trend, but it was still some of the best music we'd heard in
a long time. [Carolyn Malachi](http://www.carolynmalachi.com/) sang standards
and her own music at the latest [Party Corps](http://www.partycorps.org/)
[Music for Good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u8kn2y1B24) event, and she put
on a hell of a show. It's not easy to make a small venue feel powerful _and_
intimate, not to mention sing pitch-perfect on a cramped stage with middling
equipment and a band full of strangers, but Carolyn killed it. She mesmerized us
the whole night and left us wanting more.

[Music for Good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u8kn2y1B24) is a concert series
that connects creative emerging musicians with local worthy causes that they
feel strongly about. The proceeds go to the cause, and everyone involved
discovers new artists, new missions, and the underlying connections between
them.

We discovered [Party Corps](http://www.partycorps.org/) through
[a friend](https://www.facebook.com/LexCre8) who joined recently as showrunner,
or at least that's how we think of her. With her at the helm, the events have
gone from good to great. Thanks for introducing us! Can't wait for the next one!
