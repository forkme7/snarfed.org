Warning: this doesn't work with GMail's

I've tried to make them play nice together, but it doesn't look promising. :(

[gmail_remove_trailing_quote.user.js](https://github.com/snarfed/misc/raw/master/userscripts/gmail_remove_trailing_quote.user.js)
is a [GreaseMonkey](http://greasespot.net/)
[userscript](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/86600) that removes "trailing
quotes" from messages you compose in Gmail. It modifies your in-progress email
when you move the focus away from the composition text box. If you go back to
the text box, it reverts the changes it made so you can revise if necessary.

What's a trailing quote, you ask? It's best described by example. The last three
lines in this email are a trailing quote:

This script makes it easier to observe proper netiquette when quoting. If you
want to quote the smallest relevant piece of an email, you often need to delete
a significant amount of quoted text. This automates the drudgery of trimming
that excess quoted text. (See
[these](http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/T/top-post.html)
[articles](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/usenet/brox.html) for more on trimming
quotes and the top- vs. bottom-post debate.)
