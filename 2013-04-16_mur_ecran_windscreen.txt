If you know me, you probably already know that I'm not a fan of rain. Yes, we
need it, and plants do too, but that's why God invented irrigation, I figure. I
used to joke that some enterprising mayor should build a huge transparent dome
over their entire city so the residents would never be rained on again. I'd move
there in a heartbeat.

It may not be a rain screen, but the sub-arctic mining town of
[Fermont, Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermont) has the next best thing:
a windscreen. The temperature there routinely drops to below -20°F in the
winter, and that's _before_ you include wind chill. The myth is true: you can
literally toss a pot of boiling water into the air, and it will freeze before it
hits the ground.

The town was centrally planned and built by the
[Québec Cartier
Mining Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%C3%A9bec_Cartier_Mining_Company) (now [ArcelorMittal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcelorMittal))
in the early 1970s to service the
[Mont Wright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Wright,_Quebec) iron mine. Faced
with brutal cold and punishing storms, the town's designers conceived of a
massive, 1.3km long building that would shield the residents from the prevailing
winds out of the northwest. During the worst part of winter, 7 months per year
on average, the _entire town_ can hole up in the Mur-Écran (windscreen) building
and never have to leave. So cool!

I first heard about Fermont and the Mur-Écran from one of the [podcasts](/podcasts) I
listen to, [CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/)'s radio show
[Ideas](http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/). Check out their
[full story](http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2013/04/15/mur-ecran-the-windscreen/)
for more pictures and the hour-long show.
