After GDC, a friend of mine decided to throw a party. In true [Misha](http://misha.zatsman.com/) style, though, this wasn't a house party with 50 people.

It was [Mishapalooza](http://misha.smugmug.com/Parties/Mishapalooza/Mishapalooza/), a massive warehouse party with 600 people at its peak. It featured open bar, two dance floors, professional music and lights, a karaoke room, and..._drum roll_...jello wrestling! Oh, and some really great people. It was an incredible amount of fun.

Anyway, there are [finally](http://misha.smugmug.com/Parties/Mishapalooza/Mishapalooza/) [picture](http://mvgals.net/gallery/discoboy_Mishapalooza-031205) [albums](http://share.shutterfly.com/osi.jsp?i=EeINHLhy1btmFx) [up](http://share.shutterfly.com/osi.jsp?i=EeAM2TFu1ZtGr4w). Enjoy!
