[E3](http://www.e3expo.com/), the big game industry consumer trade show, has
come and gone. As usual, I watched

[before](http://snarfed.org/gdc_2005),
and the professionals are doing much better work anyway. One of my favorites
this year is [Leigh Alexander](http://sexyvideogameland.blogspot.com/)'s
[particularly insightful article](http://gamasutra.com/view/news/35169/Analysis_The_Key_Takeaways_From_E3_2011.php)
over at Gamasutra. It's so damn good that I'm going to quote a few paragraphs
whole cloth:

> No longer is the broad connectivity of online platform services enough.
> Publishers believe their audiences want social wrappers unique to major
> franchises everywhere it makes sense.  
> ...  
> The third-party publishers are more different from one another than ever.
> There are so many choices for how to set a brand against the market that major
> publishers are rapidly skewing toward what they are best at, and find most
> important. A glance at the show floor proves it.  
> ...  
> And this year's event played more squarely to the traditional market than ever
> before. Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo seemed eager to emphasize that their
> newest mass-market devices -- motion-controlled Kinect and Move and
> touch-based Wii U -- had numerous applications for core games...The
> hyper-focus on AAA action entertainment, and the blistering levels of quality
> and realism the industry's beginning to achieve seem actually counteractive.
