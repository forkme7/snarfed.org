<p class="right"><img class="shadow" src="/coat_small.jpg" /></p>

OK, I know it's Friday - well, technically Saturday - , and I'm just now getting
around to posting about what I did last weekend. It was an epic weekend. Don't
worry, though, I didn't write an epic poem about
it...[just a rather long post.](/mauliks_epic_visit)

(Or, if you want, just go [straight to the pictures.](/mauliks_visit_2004))
