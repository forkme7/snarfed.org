We're not evolving

Evolution has never been more popular than it is now, and rightly so. Darwin's
legacy is one of the most potent ideas ever. Not only is it a crushingly
powerful explanation of life, but its core mechanisms of reproduction,
variation, and selection apply to all sorts of other domains. Technology, memes,
and capitalism are common examples, but they're just the beginning.

We can take it a bit overboard, though, especially when we start navel gazing
and wonder how humans are evolving. We don't yet have square, keyboard-friendly
fingers, or ears with perfect earbud-shaped holes, but are we evolving shorter
attention spans, more Asperger's syndrome, or faster video game twitch reflexes?

No, we're not. First, evolution takes a _long_ time: thousands, even millions of
generations to see real changes in a phenotype. All of recorded history is still
just a couple hundred generations old. Technology and other changes in modern
life affect us profoundly on the nurture side, but not so much (yet) on the
nature side.

We've also intercepted two of evolution's three legs, selection and
reproduction, and thrown them wildly off course. Modern medicine may not be
perfect, but it does ensure that most babies survive into their adult,
childbearing years, regardless of their innate health or fitness. That throws
selection out the window.

As for reproduction, you probably know at least a few happy couples who have
chosen not to have children. Widespread birth control had a profound,
unprecedented effect on our species when it unshackled sex from procreation. It
also had an important side effect: unlike animals, the fittest people no longer
had the most or strongest children.

(Another surprising side effect is that we're _all_ having too few children. The
developed world has

the
[replacement rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate#Replacement_rates),
and it's only getting worse. Labor markets have shrunk across the world,
especially in developed regions like the EU and Japan where economies are already
stagnating. So much for [Malthus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthus) and
[Ehrlich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bomb).)

We may have disintermediated selection and reproduction, but variation is still
intact. IVF, surrogates, and adoption haven't changed the fact that sperm and
egg still mix DNA randomly to make a baby, and they still do it with good old
RNA transcription, an amazingly good natural process that nevertheless lets the
occasional mutation slip through.

Sure, [epigenetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics) is all the rage
these days, and it incorporates the environment, and
[it's even hereditary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenerational_epigenetics),
but it still just turns our _existing_ genes on and off. Epigenetics still
doesn't provide any evidence for
[Lamarckian style inheritance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism) of
skills you acquire during your lifetime, and no one expects it ever will.

It's definitely fun (slash worrying) to think about how we're adapting to
technology and modern life. Responses range from techno-utopianism to "kids
these days, get off my lawn!" The human brain is amazingly plastic, especially
when we're young, so yes, iPads and Facebook and video chat leave their mark on
us. That's not evolution though, and it's silly to pretend it is, if not
downright intellectually dishonest. Evolution isn't that good, or that fast, and
it doesn't matter since we've pulled the plug on it anyway.

The real conclusion isn't that we're evolving, but that all sorts of other
things are, in entirely new environments. Startups compete, multiply, and often
exit or fold in just a few years. Their products have even shorter lifespans.
[Superbugs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bug_%28bacteria%29) evolve
resistence to antibiotics by cranking out hundreds or even thousands of
generations in under a year. Internet memes spread like wildfire overnight.
Culture, politics, art, and many other parts of the modern world evolve at a
speed we can appreciate, leaving artifacts we can see and touch.

If you want to see evolution in action, that's where it's at. Forget the
pseudoscience; humans aren't evolving right now, and that's ok. There's so
much of it going on everywhere else!
