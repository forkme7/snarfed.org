A few weeks ago,
[Ken](https://profiles.google.com/kashcraft)
rallied a group of us to go to
[Go Kart Racer](http://www.gokartracer.com/)
after work. I was surprised at how fun it was, and also at how serious they
take it. They make it feel like real racing, with protective gear, a training
video, and a live scoreboard. They even have
[racing leagues](http://www.gokartracer.com/leagues.html)!

Most of all, I was impressed the the stats they collect. Everyone gets a
printout with times, positions, and splits at the end of the race. They even
include graphs of everyone's position at the end of each lap.

Apart from satisfying geeks like me, the stats provide lots of bragging rights
ammo. They're useful when you have to set the record straight about that
low-down dirty scoundrel who passed you on the inside lane of the hairpin.
Gotta love technology!

Even better, the stats for each race are
[published online](http://scores.oskarsystems.com/gkr/)! Extra brownie points
for that. Of course, I forgot the fake email address I gave them, so I had to
hold off on this post until I scanned in my printouts. I didn't start off so
well, but hey, cut me some slack. I'm showing signs of improvement!
