Media Consumption!

I like media. I like it in all its forms, especially the mainstream ones:
books, movies, TV, and games. I've come across some particularly good stuff
recently. If you have an hour to kill, or two, or ten, these are well worth
your time.

[Remainder](http://www.randomhouse.com/vintage/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307278357),
by [Tom McCarthy](http://www.readysteadybook.com/Article.aspx?page=tommccarthy),
is the best novel I've read in a long time. It's quirky, captivating, powerful
modern literature. It snuck up on me, and when I pulled back the curtain, it
hit me like a freight train at full speed. Highly recommended.

[Knytt](http://knytt.ni2.se/) is an striking little game. It's simply
animated, has no enemies, and only lasts a couple hours. It's overwhelmingly
immersive, though. In places, the ambience is downright haunting. I couldn't
stop playing it.

[Breakfast at Tiffany's](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054698/) is a classic,
but I hadn't seen it until recently. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The characters
are unique, and Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard are unforgettable. Hepburn is
also gorgeous, which doesn't hurt. :P I need to read the Truman Capote book
now!

I almost stopped watching [Battlestar Galactica](http://scifi.com/battlestar/)
after its over-the-top second season finale. I'm glad I gave it another chance.
The setting may be outer space, but the show is actually about religion and
spirituality, politics, interpersonal relationships, the military, and other
decidedly non-Trekkie topics. It's very, very compelling.

I've only seen parts of
[Planet Earth](http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/planetearth/), but it
rocks. Add the
[BBC](http://bbc.co.uk/), the
[Discovery Channel](http://dsc.discovery.com/), a $25M production budget, and
close-ups of animals never before caught on camera, and you get a
beautiful, riveting documentary. It's next on my [queue](http://netflix.com).

I've also enjoyed the books
[SoMa](http://kemblescott.com/) and
[Dreaming in Code](http://dreamingincode.com/),
the movies
[United 93](http://www.united93movie.com/),
[A Scanner Darkly](http://wip.warnerbros.com/ascannerdarkly/), and
[Brick](http://www.brickmovie.net/),
the games
[Psychonauts](http://psychonauts.com/) and
[Zelda: A Link to the Past](http://www.zelda.com/universe/game/past/),
and
[Lost](http://lost.abc.com/) and
[Weeds](http://sho.com/site/weeds/) on TV.
