_This patch was [applied on 8/23/2006](http://mx.gw.com/pipermail/tcsh/2006-August/003726.html). It's included in tcsh versions 6.14.06 and later._

For the impatient:  
[Patch](https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/master/patches/tcsh-no-glob-search.patch) for [tcsh 6.14.00](http://www.tcsh.org/MostRecentRelease)

I use [tcsh](http://www.tcsh.org/) as my shell, and I love it. Unfortunately, globbing breaks its history search commands. They halfway support [...] and * (character sets and wildcards), but they die on {...} and ^ (expansions and negations).

Specifically, if you use { in a history search pattern, the search is killed and prints _Missing }_. If you use ^ in a history search pattern, it treats it as a normal character (ie doesn't glob), but ignores everything after it.

The affected commands include history-search-backward, history-search-forward, i-search-back, and i-search-fwd.

After [discussing on the tcsh list](http://mx.gw.com/pipermail/tcsh/2006-January/003535.html), we decided to remove glob support in history search altogether. It's a rare use case, and we believe it's more confusing than useful.

[This patch](https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/master/patches/tcsh-no-glob-search.patch) against [tcsh
6.14.00](http://www.tcsh.org/MostRecentRelease) removes globbing support and fixes the bugs.
