If you're nearsighted, this scene will look familiar. You may not think about it
much, but I'd bet it's a fairly intimate part of your life. It's how you see the
world without your contacts or glasses on, when you're just waking up or just
going to bed or shivering out in the street at 2AM because your apartment
building's fire alarm jolted you awake and you forgot to grab your glasses on
your way out the door. In other words, at your most vulnerable.

This occurred to me a while back in the hot tub (tough life, I know) when I
didn't have my glasses on. I'm considering getting LASIK surgery, and while I'm
excited about it, I also realized I'd lose this quirky, comfortable little
uncorrected blur of shapes and light halos that's shadowed my whole life.

I immediately wondered if I could save it somehow. We hopped on the internet and
found [shallow focus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_focus),
[bokeh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh), and
[gaussian blur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur) photography, along
with
[a wide](http://www.gerhard-richter.com/art/paintings/photo_paintings/category.php?catID=20)
[range of](http://www.zhibit.org/ndeanchristensen/paintings)
[blurry paintings](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/02/dramatically-blurred-oil-paintings-by-valerio-dospina/),
but none of them were quite right.

Then we found [Philip Barlow](http://www.philipbarlow.com/), and immediately
fell in love. His stuff is perfect. The halos, the curved edges, the color
banding and artifacting are all exactly right. We were heartbroken when he said
all of his current work was spoken for, so we poked around a bit more, put it on
the back burner, and moved on.

Fast forward to [our wedding anniversary](/2013-10-18_first-anniversary), and
Gina outdid herself with her gift. She managed to reserve the very next painting
Philip had in the works. It arrived yesterday, and we hung it up today. It's
awesome. I'm still planning to get LASIK, but I now have a great reminder of how
the unfiltered world looked to me up until now.
