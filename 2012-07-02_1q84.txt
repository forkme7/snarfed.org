Have you read Haruki Murakami's new epic novel
[1Q84](http://books.google.com/books?id=SSk8YgEACAAJ)? I'm a bit beyond the
halfway point, comfortably past the big scene in the hotel room, and I enjoyed
the first "book," but the last few hundred pages have been a bit flat. I'm
debating whether to keep going.

If you've read it, did it get better? Should I finish it?

All of Murakami's writing shares the same lazy, sedated quality, to one degree
or another. It was overpowering in the short stories in
[The Elephant Vanishes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elephant_Vanishes), and
much less pronounced in novels like
[Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard-Boiled_Wonderland_and_the_End_of_the_World),
but it definitely seems like a consistent style.
[My sister](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003399395367), who loves
it, describes it as "He ate a sandwich. Then he took a nap." Quite so.
