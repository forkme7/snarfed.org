Jack Da Hat

For [Friday dinner](/friday_mexican_dinner) last week, we went to [El Sotano](http://www.nobhilldining.com/ElSotano/Home.htm), near Union Square. It was good, but unremarkable, except that it was the first combination Mexican restaurant and karaoke bar that I've ever heard of.

We hadn't paid much attention beforehand, but sure enough, we saw the equipment and little stage as soon as we walked in. By the time we finished dinner, people had started trickling in, signing up, and taking their turn on stage.

One of the early performers, [Jack "Da Hat" Luna](http://jackdahat.com/), was particularly good. He performs at regular gigs around the city, but that night he was evidently just slumming it with friends. He does New Orleans style jazz and blues, which endeared me to him immediately, since my dad's background is Cajun, and I love New Orleans and Creole culture and food.
