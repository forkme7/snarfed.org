Public Service Announcement: if you buy a downloadable game from from
[Got Game Entertainment](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/), watch out!
I bought [Bad Mojo: Redux](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/badmojo/), and
its [DRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) locked me
out of the game. Worse, their tech support couldn't help. I finally ended up
[fixing it myself...](/bad_mojo_redux_from_got_game_entertainment)
