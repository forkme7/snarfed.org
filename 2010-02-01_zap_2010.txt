I just finished writing up my
[notes](/zap_2010_wine) from
[ZAP](http://www.zinfandel.org/default.asp?n1=14&n2=487),
the Zinfandel tasting at Fort Mason last Saturday.

In just a few hours, Gina,
[Cynthia](http://originalcynk.com/blog/),
[Josh](http://joshuaredstone.blogspot.com/), and I tasted a ton of
wines from Zinfandel makers from all over California. Standouts included
[Acorn](http://www.acornwinery.com/),
[Barnard Griffin](http://www.barnardgriffin.com/),
[Brown Estate](http://www.brownestate.com/),
[Ridge](http://www.ridgewine.com/), and
[Truchard](http://www.truchardvineyards.com/).

See [the full list](/zap_2010_wine) for more.
See you there next year!
