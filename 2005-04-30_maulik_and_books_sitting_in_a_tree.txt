Maulik and books, sitting in a tree...

Recently, [Maulik](/Maulik) has been tearing through books, both audio and
the more traditional paper kind, at a blistering pace. What's more, he has
impeccable taste. I've come to trust his recommendations, and I'm far from the
only one.

To make things easier on all of us, he whipped up a full-fledged [book
recommendation
engine](http://maulik.freeshell.net/Miki.pl?page=Reading+Log.miki) from scratch.
It has navigation, statistics, and even those
[tags](http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0405d.shtml) that all the kids are using
these days. Maulik wields
[AJAX](http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php) like
a finely balanced samurai sword, and it shows.

In comparison, I'm ashamed to admit that the [books](/books) page on
snarfed is woefully out of date. I should update it, since I've read a number of
stellar books recently - [Set This House in
Order](http://home.att.net/~storytellers/sethouse.html), [The Diamond
Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age), [The Digital
Person](http://www.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Solove-Digital-Person.htm), and
[Mind Hacks](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mindhks/), just to name a few.
Unfortunately, I'm lazy. :P
