New office!

I moved into a new office on Tuesday, in our
[San Francisco building](/directions_to_google), and I'm really happy with it.
I've been [back](/2004-12-02_suburbia_ho)
[and](/2009-05-31_looking_for_a_roommate_in_sf) [forth](/2010-05-07_back_to_work)
between the Mountain View headquarters and here a few times, and I've lost count
of all the different cubes and offices I've had. Easily more than 20, across at
least 8 buildings. No joke. Happily, this is one of the best I can remember. I
think I'll keep it for a while.

I actually have a good home office. Simple layout, nice library desk, big
monitor for screen real estate, sheltered from noise and activity. It even has a
proper ball instead of a chair, since that's how I roll. (...sorry.)

Even so, it never really stuck. I always preferred going in to work,
distractions and all. I used to claim it was the latency, but I kept going in
even after I switched from working remotely with
[emacs server](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html)
to [shells in emacs](/why_i_run_shells_inside_emacs) and
[sshfs](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html), which got rid of the
per-keystroke round trips in editing files and command lines. If it wasn't the
latency, then what?

This new office made the answer blindingly clear: natural light. I love natural
light, and for
[good reason](http://www.ehow.com/facts_5729290_effects-lighting-mood-alertness.html).
It doesn't need to be bright - it actually shouldn't be - but my home office is
_dark_. All it has to offer is small, frosted glass windows and weak overhead
incandescent bulbs. It feels like a cave. I'm down for that sometimes, but not
often.

The light in the new office is great. Big windows on two sides, steady light
throughout the day, no direct sunlight. Plus, a big, green, deciduous tree fills
the view out the window I face. I _love_ that. Throw in a few small desk lamps,
and it feels like a cool autumn afternoon at a lake house. Quiet, relaxed,
breezy, contemplative. Perfect.

Sure, the latency is a bit better, the screen real estate is a bit bigger, and
spending core hours with my team in person is a must. I like them, too, which
doesn't hurt. Still, the office is a big draw. I'm psyched to hang out in it
more.

Thanks for letting me crash, Slade. [Haruki](https://www.facebook.com/harukioh),

for you!
