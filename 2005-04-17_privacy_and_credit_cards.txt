If you've known me for any length of time, you know that I'm a privacy freak. I
can't explain why, but I'm hyper-sensitive about giving out personal
information. I practically hyperventilate when I consider all the databases of
things I've bought, people I've called, and movies I've watched. I may not be
especially private about my desktop or my personal life...but
[I'll be damned if Safeway needs my phone number or address](/privacy_through_prepaid_credit_cards)
to sell me a loaf of bread.
