Comment: Phones aren't relevant

Agreed...but I wonder if the difference is largely academic. For a big provider, I expect the difference in cost for a voice and non-voice user is roughly zero. Same with price, as you mention, at least for the plans we'd use. A new data-only provider would almost certainly rent an existing network, and I doubt the owner would give them a discount for not using voice circuits. Regardless, it'll be fun to see how it shakes out!
