Facebook comments vs. Twitter replies

[A](http://cl8on.blog.com/) [few](http://originalcynk.com/)
[friends](http://www.thefacebookera.com/media.php) and I have an ongoing
discussion about differences between [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) and
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/). We recently focused on one in particular:
replying. Facebook [comments](http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=12428) are
fundamentally different from
[status updates](http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=12872), but Twitter
<nobr>[@ replies](http://support.twitter.com/articles/221188)</nobr> are still
normal [tweets](http://support.twitter.com/articles/219954). That makes me sad.

I don't post to Facebook much, or Twitter at all, apart from
[syndicating this blog](http://twitter.com/snarfed_org), but I do read
[friends' tweets](http://twitter.com/snarfed_org/following) and
[Facebook posts](/2009-03-05_facebook_friend_lists) via
[RSS](http://support.twitter.com/articles/15361-how-to-find-your-rss-feed), and
I occasionally want to reply. On Facebook I comment, like I would on a blog, but
I never reply on Twitter.

However, I read a friend's tweet the other day and wanted to respond enough that
I almost went ahead. My immediate "hell no" reaction was so strong, so visceral
that it surprised me. I stopped what I was doing for a moment, took a step back,
and tried to figure out why.

I eventually realized that I wanted more control over how and when people see my
replies. Facebook and Twitter both broadcast, ie push, status updates and
tweets. However, Facebook doesn't broadcast comments the same way. People only
see the content of a comment when they look at its original subject, and even
then, the comment is understated, secondary to the subject itself.

Twitter, on the other hand, broadcasts replies the same way it broadcasts normal
tweets. [New Twitter](http://twitter.com/newtwitter) dramatically improves
context and threading, but that's not the same thing. The extra information is a
kind of positive context, but what I want is _negative_ context. I don't want
people to see my replies, or even know I replied at all, unless they explicitly
choose to read the original tweet that I replied to.

This unified broadcast was a conscious design decision on Twitter's part.
Facebook status updates and comments are inherently different things, but
<nobr>@ replies</nobr> are still tweets. That's understandable, since they
originally weren't a feature at all, but
[Twitter continued broadcasting them](http://blog.twitter.com/2008/05/how-replies-work-on-twitter-and-how.html)
like normal tweets even after building in explicit support. They're toned down a
bit, in that they're
[hidden if you don't follow the original author](http://blog.twitter.com/2008/05/how-replies-work-on-twitter-and-how.html),
but that's little help with the common case of one of your friends replying to
another.

I understand the draws of simplicity, inclusivity, and emergent structure. As a
product developer, I might even prefer the direction Twitter's chosen. As a
user, though, it just doesn't work for me. My standard for broadcasting is much
higher than for replying. That's probably why I comment on Facebook, but I'll
only _post_ here, where I have enough space to form ideas, craft prose, and
tweak layout.

Still, it makes me sad. I read as many updates from friends on Twitter now as on
Facebook, if not more, and I'd love to reply to them. Twitter just doesn't let
me do that the way I want to. Sigh.
