_Update: check out the writeups and pictures from [Greece](/2012-07-02_sailing_the_greek_cyclades) and [Italy](/2012-07-07_venice_florence_tuscany)!_

I'm heading out on vacation for the next month or so. If you're trying to find me and can't, that's probably why.

We're celebrating [my dad](http://one-one.net/team.htm)'s 60th birthday and his mother's 90th (!) by sailing around the Cyclades in Greece for a while, than poking around Venice, Florence, and wine country in Italy, and finally stopping in London on our way back. I'm not sure why London either. I think all the future Mediterranean warmth gave us heat stroke in the middle of planning and we got confused.

We're hoping Greece can hang onto the Euro for a few more weeks before throwing in the towel and pulling the drachmas out of mothballs. It looks like the [New Democracy party won the election](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18482415), which is good both for the world and for tourists like us. Still, we figure they'll be so happy to see money coming _into_ the country, [and not out of it](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-07/capital-flight-leaves-banks-in-germany-awash-in-cheap-deposits.html), we'll probably get a small island or two for what we'd spend on t-shirts and souvenirs elsewhere.

I know, I know, it's a tough life. Try to feel a little sorry for me.
