Congratulations to Kieran and Acquia

<a href="http://acquia.com/"><img class="right" src="acquia.png" /></a>

I've been mum about this for a while, but they
[announced themselves](http://acquia.com/node/10) last week, so I can finally
offer my congratulations in public to [Kieran](http://acquia.com/blog/3) and
[Acquia](http://acquia.com/) on
[closing $7M in series A funding](http://acquia.com/press-release-1).
Acquia is building a distribution of the popular CMS
[Drupal](http://drupal.org/), similar to what [Red Hat](http://redhat.com/) et
al have done for Linux.

In addition to working at [CivicSpace](http://civicspacelabs.org/) previously,
Kieran is a [Drupal board member](http://association.drupal.org/about/staff)
and an [active contributor](http://drupal.org/user/18703) in the community.
He's put a lot of time and effort into co-founding Acquia, so I'm glad to see
they're off to a good start.

P.S. Merry Christmas, everyone!
