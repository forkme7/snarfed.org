Podcasts I Listen To

<p class="right third"><a href="/podcasts"><img class="" src="/podcast.jpg" /></a></p>

I've posted a [list of podcasts I listen to](/podcasts). I listen mostly
while I'm running or at the gym, but sometimes also when I'm coding, playing
games, or whatever else.

Most are news, current events, and game industry analysis. Examples include
[BBC NewsPod](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/podcasts/newspod),
[Marketplace](http://marketplace.publicradio.org/episodes/show_rundown.php?show_id=14),
[Game Theory](http://gametheoryshow.com),
[GDC Radio](http://www.gdcradio.net/),
and [Radio Lab](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab), which I've
[gushed about before](/2007-07-23_radiolab).

Thanks to [Fletcher Penney](http://fletcherpenney.net/) for
[opml2markdown.xslt](http://fletcher.freeshell.org/wiki/Markdown_and_XML),
which I used to generate the list.
