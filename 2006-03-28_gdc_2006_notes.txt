GDC 2006 notes

<a href="/gdc_2006"><img src="/gdc2006.jpg"></a>

This was my fifth year at [GDC](http://gdconf.com/), and as always, it's a lot
of fun to take a break for a bit and immerse myself in an entirely different
world. It's also a little overwhelming, so I had to take a few days to let the
sleep deprivation and brain overload wear off before I could
[type up my notes](/gdc_2006).
