Changed my Twitter username

<p class="right third"><a href="https://twitter.com/schnarfed">

The underscore thing was clunky and awkward, and I never got used to it. [@snarfed_org](https://twitter.com/snarfed_org) is dead, long live [@schnarfed](https://twitter.com/schnarfed)!

Fortunately, Twitter makes this [very easy](https://support.twitter.com/articles/14609-how-to-change-your-username#). All my tweets, followers, and settings stayed in place. Thanks guys!
