Engagement photos

Before we got married, we did the traditional
[engagement session](http://wedding.theknot.com/getting-engaged/engagement-photo-ideas.aspx)
with [our photographer](http://ashleymaxwellphoto.com/). I didn't think we
needed it at first, and it's a bit odd to see ourselves striking poses like
models, but even so, the pictures turned out pretty good. Thanks Ashley!
