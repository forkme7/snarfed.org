Posting to the indieweb from your phone

Using the indieweb easily from my phone has been
[a bit of a](/easy-indieweb-interactions-on-android)
[hobby horse of mine](indie-checkin-flow)
[for a while now](/indieweb-press-this-bookmarklets-for-wordpress). Over the
weekend, a few of us
[briefly discussed](https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-05-30#t1433011785618) the
"next big thing" for the indieweb in IRC, and one idea that caught my eye was an
"offline first" mobile client that's fully functional without connectivity and
syncs to your site when it is connected. This is a small but growing pattern
among modern mobile apps, and it's _great_.

We could build this as a native mobile app or library, maybe using an
[existing](https://simperium.com/) [mobile](https://parse.com/)
[offline](https://www.firebase.com/)
[sync](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore)
[platform](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), but the indieweb community prefers
the web to native apps. So, let's use the web!

Here's a straw man design for a self-contained, browser-based
[micropub](http://micropub.net/) client on top of HTML5 and localStorage (which
[all modern mobile browsers support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=namevalue-storage)):
* You load it in your phone's browser, then save it so it's usable offline.
* When you're connected, it fetches your site, crawls your feeds, and stores
  your posts locally. Maybe all of them, maybe the most recent or another
  heuristic.
* You can compose new posts and edit existing posts offline, using only
  localStorage.
* When you're connected, it publishes your updates via micropub.

Bonus features:
* You can easily post pictures, videos, links, and other content by
  sharing/sending them to the editor via deep linking (aka intents aka app links).
* It downloads and uses other data from your site (or elsewhere) to provide a
  better posting UX, e.g.
  [nicknames-cache](http://indiewebcamp.com/nicknames-cache),
  [venue](http://indiewebcamp.com/venue) database,
  [syndication](http://indiewebcamp.com/rel-syndication) targets.
* It registers for [web actions](http://indiewebcamp.com/webactions) so you
  can use it to easily indie [reply](http://indiewebcamp.com/reply),
  [like](http://indiewebcamp.com/like), etc.
* It downloads your moderation queue, ie pending
  [webmentions](http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention) and native comments, and
  lets you approve or reject them. (We don't yet have a standard for this.)

There are plenty of example apps with good UXes for managing posts offline and
updating when connected. [WordPress](https://apps.wordpress.org/) is a great
one. They're worth studying for UI ideas and techniques.

This isn't an [itch](http://indiewebcamp.com/itches) for me personally, so I'm
probably not the right person to build it, but I'd love to see it happen. Who's
interested?
