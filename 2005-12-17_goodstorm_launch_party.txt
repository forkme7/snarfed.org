[Kieran](http://civicspacelabs.org/home/blog/kieran) graciously invited
[Dan](http://kodiak.brainymonkey.com/) and me to the
[GoodStorm](http://www.goodstorm.com/) [launch
party](http://www.goodstorm.com/story/2005/12/14/goodlaunch) a few nights ago.
It was a good time, a good group of people, and a very, very good cause. It was
also a good excuse to shamelessly abuse the word _good_ all night long. :P

Dan posted a pretty complete [writeup](http://kodiak.brainymonkey.com/?p=163),
so instead of reinventing the wheel, I'll just blatantly plagiarize him:

> Last night I headed into the city with a [friend](http://ryan.barret.name) to
> attend the [GoodStorm](http://www.goodstorm.com) launch party. If you are not
> familiar with GoodStorm it is a pretty cool idea. Basically Cafe Press with a
> heart and they are really out there trying to help community groups and
> non-profits get their message out and fund raise. The party was in a [nice
> little book store](http://www.valenciastreetbooks.com/) in the Mission.
> 
> The crowd was a really interesting mix of people from the various groups
> ([Cross Left](http://www.crossleft.org/) was right next to [Think
> Blue](http://www.thinkbluedems.com/index.php)) that were participating with
> GoodStorm at the time of the launch and friends of the people that actual made
> it happen. It is pretty sweet when you figure that the whole site and company
> was basically thought of and build in about 6 months by a couple dozen people.
> Got to love it.

> Following the launch party Ryan, Kieran and I headed over to Madjool for the
