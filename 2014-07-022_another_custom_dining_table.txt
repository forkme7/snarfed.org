Since I sourced and designed
[my single slab dining room table](/2010-08-27_table_pictures) a few years ago,
I have a newfound appreciation for people who make their own furniture.
So when a friend sent me
[this writeup of a single slab bubinga walnut table](http://imgur.com/a/GUEdg) -
same wood as mine - I had to post it here.

He did much of the same research as me, and and came to most of the same
conclusions. He also did the hard work of cutting, finishing, and mounting his
slab, while I punted to the pros at [Live Edge](http://liveedge.com/). Plus, his
writing is pretty amusing, including gems like this:

> I sanded for over 30 hours total for the top and bottom. In my mind I
> convinced myself that I working hard and that in some greater scheme of things
> the harder I worked, the more fulfilled I'd be with the final product, but no.
> I was an idiot who didn't do the proper research. Get the right tools for the
> job.

Definitely worth reading!
