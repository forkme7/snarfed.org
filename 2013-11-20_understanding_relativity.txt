I think I finally understood relativity, just now, thanks to the first half hour
of Prof. Nima Arkani-Hamed's
_[Future of Fundamental Physics](http://www.cornell.edu/video/nima-arkani-hamed-quantum-mechanics-and-spacetime/e5031)_
lecture series. Space-time too. Quantum mechanics is up next, but I'm not
holding my breath for that one. Let's just say I'm not a full-fledged physicist!

I'm still curious about one thing. Arkani-Hamed begins his explanation of
relativity at 21:20 with an assumption: _if_ you believe there's a limit on how
far objects can affect each other, at least within a given amount of time, ie
how fast they can send a signal or travel..._then_ lots of implications,
culminating in relativity.

I understand the intuition behind this, it's definitely something we'd naturally
want to believe, but plenty (most?) of modern physics is counterintuitive. Why
did they take this one intuition for granted?

I'm sure I'm just missing something simple, and it's still a great talk series
so far. Looking forward to the rest!
