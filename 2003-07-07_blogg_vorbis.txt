blogg vorbis

hi all. since there's a link here from [my site](/ryan.barrett.name/), i
guess i should explain.

this site will be a central web site for our draw group to post pictures, video,
news posts, and just general updates about where we are and what kinds of
trouble we've gotten ourselves into. it's still in development, but it's nearing
completion. until then, check out some [pictures](/pictures), send me
comments, or register and post something yourself!

(note: this will eventually be at [http://snarfed.org/](/),
but right now that points to
[http://kash.stanford.edu/](http://kash.stanford.edu/) for no good reason.)
