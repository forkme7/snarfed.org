Stray cat

Found her on my walk home, stiff and shivering and nothing but skin and bones. Even in that state, she leaned into my petting and purred and let me carry her the three blocks to our house.



It took her a while to get comfortable, even with slaked thirst and a full belly, but she's down now. We'll see what the morning brings.
