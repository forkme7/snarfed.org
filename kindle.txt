Amazon Kindle

I do most of my reading on an [Amazon Kindle](http://kindle.com/) and in the
Kindle app on my phone. Here are some notes on how I use it.

I've had a few Kindles over the years; I'm currently on an e-ink
[Touch 4](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_bc_nav?ie=UTF8&nodeId=200711730).
Reading on LED screens usually gives me a bit of eye strain, so I prefer e-ink
when I can. I originally bought the
[cheaper version with ads](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200671290)
("special offers") on the lock screen, and later decided to pay the $20
difference to get rid of them. I'm glad they allow that.

I also use the
[Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle)
on my phone. Amazon does a good job of synching my current position across the
two devices in books, but it doesn't sync position in digital magazines or
[personal documents](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=kinw_myk_pd_ln?ie=UTF8&nodeId=200767340),
which is disappointing, but not a big deal.

I usually buy books on Amazon's
[Kindle store](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b?ie=UTF8&node=154606011) for
convenience. Sadly, most of them are DRMed. I strip the DRM by downloading the
books to my computer and running
[KindleBooks](https://github.com/weeksatimd/bin/blob/master/tools_v4.5/KindleBooks/README_KindleBooks.txt)
(n√©e K4MobiDeDRM/Topaz_Tools). Amazon's DRM encrypts books for each device
individually, using its serial number as the key, so I pass KindleBooks my
serial number by running `KindleBooks_4.7/lib/k4mobidedrm.py -s [SERIAL_NO]
[BOOK_FILE]`. I open the resulting `.mobi` files in
[Calibre](http://calibre.org/) occasionally to check that they're readable.

Occasionally I'll get a ebook somewhere else in non-DRM [epub] or [mobi] format,
or a paper or other document in PDF. I get them onto my Kindle and phone
[via email](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=kinw_myk_pd_ln?ie=UTF8&nodeId=200767340).
I also use the [Push to Kindle](http://fivefilters.org/kindle-it/) bookmarklet
to send web articles and blog posts. It's great, I love it. Amazon has its own
[Send to Kindle service](http://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle) that I'll
probably try and compare. There are [also sites](http://kindlefeeder.com/)
[for sending](http://sendtoreader.com/periodicals/)
[RSS feeds](http://kindle4rss.com/).

The Kindle is usually very reliable, but it's frozen on me a few times. To reset
it, I
[press and hold power button for 20s, then let go](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200829000).
