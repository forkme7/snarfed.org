Pottery Barn
[featured our wedding on their blog](http://weddingblog.potterybarn.com/gina-ryans-classic-villa-montalvo-wedding/)!
They posted a cute writeup and a bunch of pictures
[from our album](/wedding). Thanks guys!

All the outreach credit goes to our wedding planners, Janece and Lori at
[Every Elegant Detail](http://everyelegantdetail.com/). After asking Gina to
marry me, finding and hiring them was easily the best wedding decision we made.
We couldn't recommend them more highly.

Good times, great memories. Love you, Gina! Here's to many more years together!
