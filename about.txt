[snarfed.org](/) has been around [since early 2002](/snarfed_org_history). It was
[born](/2003-07-18_its_live) on my own server, which lived first in dorm rooms at
school and then in an apartment in SF. It later
[migrated](/2004-12-02_suburbia_ho) to a
[Linux VPS](http://jvds.com/virtuozzo_linux.php) at [JVDS](http://jvds.com/),
and finally to its [current home](/2006-08-23_virtual_housewarming) on a
[shared FreeBSD server](http://pair.com/services/web_hosting/) at
[pair.com](http://pair.com/).

On the software side, it started on [SnipSnap](http://snipsnap.org/), then
[moved](/2006-08-23_virtual_housewarming) to
[PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/), and
[now runs](/2010-08-08_migrated_to_wordpress) on
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), first on
[its own theme](/snarfed_wordpress_theme) and now on a
[modified Ryu theme](/2013-06-16_redesigned). See my [software page](/software)
for more of its custom patches, plugins, and themes.
