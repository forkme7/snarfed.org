snarfed.org has been around [since early 2002](snarfed_org_history). It was
[born](2003-07-18_its_live) on my own server, which lived first in dorm rooms at
school and then in an apartment in SF. It later
[migrated](2004-12-02_suburbia_ho) to a
[Linux VPS](http://jvds.com/virtuozzo_linux.php) at [JVDS](http://jvds.com/),
and finally to its [current home](2006-08-23_virtual_housewarming) on a
[shared FreeBSD server](http://pair.com/services/web_hosting/) at
[pair.com](http://pair.com/).

On the software side, it started on [SnipSnap](http://snipsnap.org/), then
[moved](2006-08-23_virtual_housewarming) to
[PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/), and
[now runs](2010-08-08_migrated_to_wordpress) on
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), first on
[its own theme](/snarfed_wordpress_theme) and now on a modified
[Ryu](http://wordpress.org/themes/ryu/) theme. See my [software page](software)
for more of its custom patches, plugins, and themes.
