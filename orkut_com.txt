<a href="http://orkut.com/"><img class="shadow" src="/orkut.png" /></a>
is a social networking site that's near and dear to my heart. It's written by a
good friend of mine named, surprisingly enough,
[Orkut](http://cs.stanford.edu/~orkut/). He's been writing social networking
sites since he was in the womb. This one is his latest and greatest, and it's
sponsored by his (and my) employer, [Google](http://google.com/).

Having said that, I don't use social networking sites much, and Orkut profiles
are only available to Orkut members...but just to close the loop, here's [my
Orkut profile](http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=14200471339695905655).
