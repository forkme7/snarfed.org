People don't matter

<p class="right"><img src="people_silhouettes.jpg" /></p>

We like people. No, scratch that; we _love_ people. They're the most important
thing in the world, at least in our eyes. We think they can do anything they put
their mind to. We idolize Gandhi and Steve Jobs, vilify Hitler and Steve
Ballmer, and perpetuate the cult of personality that insists that every single
one of us has the potential for limitless good - or evil! - if we only muster
our courage, push as far as we can, and grab that golden ring.

I'm not so sure. I see that potential, but I'm not convinced that the primary
catalyst is inside us, whether you call it passion or drive or willpower or
anything else. Instead, the evidence seems to be mounting that environment plays
a much larger role, even more than the most nurture-biased, “His childhood made
him do it!” social progressive might think. The traditional
[nature vs. nurture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture) debate
may focus on developmental psychology and biology, but I'm thinking about how we
live our lives as adults. We trumpet role models and self improvement and
achievement, but I wonder if instead, we should think a bit more about
environments and systems and incentives.

The latest military scandal is a perfect example. Frustrated and hungry for
action, a few infantrymen in Afghanistan
[formed an underground “kill team,”](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-kill-team-20110327)
methodically scouted for the perfect time and place, murdered three Afghani
civilians in cold blood, and cut off one of the victims' fingers as a trophy.
The truly stunning part was yet to come: the whistleblower, Adam Winfield,
protested that he'd never meant to out his squadmates. He'd hesitated at the
moment of truth, aimed away from the victims and shot into the air, but when the
kill team was finally brought to light, Winfield's highest moral imperative was
to stand with his brothers in arms, even if it meant standing by while they
murdered innocent bystanders.

Winfield is ethically confused, to put it mildly. He won't commit murder
himself, but he allows his teammates to do it and helps them try to cover it up,
all of which seems inconceivable to us. We can't what imagine doing what he did,
much less what his kill-teammates did. We have no frame of reference for killing
innocent people, protecting anyone else who does, or announcing it with pride
after the fact.

That may sound unfair. War is nothing if not extenuating circumstances, right?
But that's my point exactly. So far there's no evidence that any of the kill
team members were led astray by psychological issues. On the contrary,
Winfield's character witnesses were positively glowing. And yet, after the
Army's basic training broke them down, built them back up, turned them into
warriors, and sent them into a confused, demoralizing mashup of
counterinsurgency and nation building, these men snapped. No wonder the
military's suicide rate has spiked so drastically over the last decade. They may
not be bad _people_, but it's hard to imagine a worse _environment_.

History is rife with war crimes and
[Guantanamo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp)-esque
atrocities, but militaries don't have a monopoly on "breaking bad." The
[Stanford prison experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment)
is a vivid, compelling example of how little it can take to turn ordinary people
into monsters. So too, sadly, are at least some of the Columbine style mass
killings that consume the press and Congress these days. Toxic environments seem
to breed tragedy.

Fortunately, there's a flipside. We love to put famous scientists and inventors
on pedestals, but it's now
[widely](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/05/12/080512fa_fact_gladwell)
[accepted](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594487715) that many big
ideas over the course of history were
[independently discovered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery) by
multiple people at around the same time. Nobel prizes and other awards are now
routinely awarded to two or three people, or more, responsible for the same
discovery. This neatly follows the idea of the
[adjacent possible](http://www.theoryofmind.org/pieces/AAAPT.html), coined by
Stuart Kauffman and expanded
[by Kevin Kelly](http://www.kk.org/books/what-technology-wants.php) and others.

Science and innovation are cumulative, building on themselves over time. If you
visualize ideas in a physical space, each one next to others it's related to,
you can trace a boundary between the ideas we've discovered and the ones we
haven't yet. We can't discover an idea way out on the horizon, since we haven't
discovered its necessary building blocks, but the ideas on the boundary are ripe
for the taking. All of their precedents are inside the boundary, fresh in the
workplaces and desks of big thinkers across the world. We shouldn't be surprised
when a handful of them come up with the same new idea at the same time. We
should _expect_ it.

Along the same lines, [Steven Johnson](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/)
recently
[classified 300 major scientific and technological innovations](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/business/31every.html)
along two dimensions, individual vs group and amateur vs professional. The
earliest innovations tended to come from individual amateurs, but as time
marched on, the center of gravity shifted toward teams and for-profit
entrepreneurs. We romanticize the self-taught genius and the garage inventor,
but in reality, market incentives and the idea mixing bowls of cities and the
Internet are driving today's innovations.

Yes, people are different from each other, and those differences do matter. In
many ways, people are probably
[even more different than we think](/2012-05-21_first_agree_on_the_goal). Draw
any bell curve and you'll find a Hitler on one end and a Mother Teresa on the
other. However, we're also much more _alike_ than we think. Behavioral
psychologists like
[Daniel Kahneman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) and
[Dan Ariely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ariely) have gained widespread
attention for their research on common cognitive biases. They and their
colleagues show that not only are we not rational actors, common situations tend
to make us all _irrational_ in the same distinct, highly predictable ways.
[Framing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_%28psychology%29) is my
favorite example, but it's only one of many. We may have drastically different
tastes and goals, but when it comes to our behavior, we're often more reactive
than proactive, more predictable than individual.

So, what's the conclusion? If we run with this idea that environment and
incentives have more impact than we think, and individual people less, politics
is one obvious place to start. Term limits notwithstanding, we should focus less
on individual politicians and more on policy and systemic reform. Even if we
hate our elected officials, "throw the bums out" probably isn't the answer. More
bums are lined up behind them, waiting to take their place. By all means, throw
them out and vote in better ones, but don't stop there. That's just treating the
symptom. We need to address the root cause, not just people passing through.

This may be a bitter pill to swallow for libertarians, Tea Partiers, and civil
rights advocates who love the cure-alls of personal responsibility and
accountability. Their cause has always resonated with me, but I'm a bit more
reluctant now. “Nanny state” is a pejorative for a reason, but if our
environments are really this powerful, there may yet be a role for a heavy hand,
whether it's government's or someone else's. It definitely wouldn't be the first
time I've
[flip-flopped on my political views](/2012-02-21_reconsidering_my_politics).

Politics is just the start. We're infatuated with the promise of humankind in
every facet of life, and it blinds us to the alternatives. When you have a
problem at work, or at school, or with family or friends, how often does the
answer seem to be that someone is in the wrong and they need to change? Or if
they can't, you figure you need to kick them to the curb and find someone
better, right? Try this instead: take a hard look at the _situation_. Which
structural patterns are contributing to that problem? Which parts of the
environment are encouraging bad behavior? How could you reform them to encourage
better behavior?

The more I think about it, the more I think that
[Thomas Sowell's unconstrained vision](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3047.A_Conflict_Of_Visions)
has it right. Sure, people matter. They're the most important part of life, bar
none. But when you want to solve problems and make the world a better place,
don't think about people. You'll never do it by separating the good apples from
bad, by forcing or persuading people to be better. Think about the organizations
we work in, the environments we play in, and the ecosystems we live in. Change
those for the better, and the people will change themselves.
