Ever since we launched [App Engine](http://appengine.google.com/), its logo was
always one of our favorite things. It took us a while to settle on the final
candidate, a cheerful, cartoony winged jet engine, and we had our fair share of
false starts, especially all the well-meaning variations on an engine block that
never quite came together.

Google announced
[a new set of logos for their entire cloud platform](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2013/12/an-ode-to-sharkon.html)
today, including App Engine. They knew people loved the old logo, and would miss
it, so they wrote
[a really nice memorial](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2013/12/an-ode-to-sharkon.html)
as part of the announcement, including lots of great pictures of the process.
They also included shout-outs to [Brett](http://www.onebigfluke.com/) and
[Rafe](http://rafe.net/), who deserve the credit for leading the charge to keep
working with marketing and graphic designers and find a logo we all truly loved,
instead of one we just tolerated.

Great post, and great memories. Sharkon is dead, long live sharkon!
