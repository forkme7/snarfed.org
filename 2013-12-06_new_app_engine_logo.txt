Ever since we launched [App Engine](http://appengine.google.com/), its logo was always one of our favorite things. It took us a while to settle on the final candidate, a [cheerful, cartoony winged jet engine](/app_engine_logo_final.png), and we had our fair share of false starts. We started by banged our heads against variations on an engine block, of all things, which never quite came together.

Google announced [a new set of logos for their entire cloud platform](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2013/12/an-ode-to-sharkon.html) today, including App Engine. They knew people loved the old logo and would miss it, so they [included a nice memorial](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2013/12/an-ode-to-sharkon.html) in the announcement with lots of great pictures and stories.

They also made shout-outs to [Brett](http://www.onebigfluke.com/) and [Rafe](http://rafe.net/), who led the charge to work with marketing and graphic design and find a logo we all truly loved, instead of one we just tolerated.

Great post, great memories. Sharkon is dead, long live sharkon!
