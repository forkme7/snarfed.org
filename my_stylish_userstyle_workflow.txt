my Stylish userstyle workflow

I like [userstyles](http://userstyles.org/help/userstyles), and I use
[Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108/) to manage mine.
I've also [written](more_minimalist_gmail)
[a number](google_calendar_simplified_userstyle)
[of](google_tasks_simplified_userstyle)
[userstyles](ryans_dark_userstyle), which I have to tweak and fix on a regular
basis.

Unfortunately, Stylish's development workflow doesn't work well for me. I edit
everything with [Emacs](/?s=emacs), store everything in
[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/), and avoid the mouse at all costs.
I go to great lengths to make my
[edit-compile-test loop](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000023.html)
as quick and painless as possible.

Stylish, on the other hand, doesn't natively support external editors. Its GUI
requires lots of mouse clicks. It stores userstyles in a
[SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) database, so I can't edit or symlink userstyle
files on disk, which means I'm constantly copying their contents back and forth
to version control. All of that makes my edit-compile-test loop slow,
cumbersome, and error prone.

[I asked on userstyles.org](http://forum.userstyles.org/comments.php?DiscussionID=15890),
and the responses pointed to
[It's All Text](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125) and
[Stylish-Custom](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/12105/), which add
support for external editors and import and export. That lets me use Emacs, but
doesn't avoid the GUI or mouse or help me keep my userstyles in files under
version control.

I searched for other workarounds, found more that didn't work, and almost gave
up hope when I chanced upon a couple solutions. First, the
[CSS `@import` directive](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-cascade/#import). It lets me
put a single `@import` in the Stylish userstyle that points to a file in my
local version control workspace, e.g.:

    @import "file:///home/ryanb/src/userscripts/more_minimalist_gmail.css";
    @-moz-document url-prefix(http), url-prefix(file) {}

<a href="http://gnu.org/software/emacs">
  <img class="right" src="gnu.jpg" /></a>

(The `@-moz-document` rule is odd, but necessary. Stylish uses `@-moz-document`
rules to determine whether it should include a userstyle in the context menus
for a given page. This catch-all explicitly tells Stylish to include the
userstyle in every page.)

The next step was to make Stylish reload the imported CSS files when they
changed. I could use the GUI to force a reload by going to "Manage user
styles...", opening the userstyle, and clicking Preview or Save, but that was
too painful and mouse-heavy.

Eventually, I noticed that Stylish extends the View => Page Style menu with
items for each active userstyle, which I could use to turn them on and off and
force a reload. I could now do it entirely with the keyboard: `Alt-V Y 1, Alt-V
Y 1`. Woohoo!

Granted, this is all still very hacky, but it works for me.
