SLIDE 1
-------
A, B, C, D, and E are connected to the network. A, B, and D are playing synchronized MP3s.

X wants to join the network. She begins by sending a CONNECT message to E. She then requests a copy of the current LKA.


SLIDE 2
-------
E sends X a copy of the current LKA.


The LKA is the Last Known Address table, which stores the <username, IP address> mappings for each node on the network.


SLIDE 3
-------
Now that X has the LKA, she can connect to more nodes on the network. She connects to B and sends a HELLO message, which includes her <username, IP address> mapping.

X also sends a HELLO to E.


SLIDE 4
-------
B and E forward X's HELLO message to all of the nodes they are connected to. This continues until all nodes on the network have seen the HELLO message.

If X is running the syncher plugin, B can also send her synch data.

SLIDE 5
-------
Now X is completely connected and integrated into the network. She can also synch her MP3 player if she wants. Holla!!!
