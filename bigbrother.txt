[Bigbrother](/bigbrother) is a program that calculates statistics about your away message history. It parses a log file of all of the away messages you've used, then generates a report with graphs about when and how often you do different things, based on your away message history. It's best described by [example](/ryan.barrett.name/bigbrother/).

Bigbrother has two parts: a Gaim plugin which logs your away messages, and an analyzer which crunches the logs and generates a report.

The Gaim plugin requires [Gaim](http://gaim.sf.net/) .68 or higher and [Perl](http://perl.org/) 5.004 or higher. The analyzer requires [Python](http://python.org/) 2.2 or higher.
