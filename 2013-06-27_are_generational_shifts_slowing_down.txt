Are generational shifts slowing down?

I read Jaron Lanier's
_[You Are Not a Gadget](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6683549-you-are-not-a-gadget)_
recently, and I liked it a lot. Some of his arguments are more compelling than
others, and I'm not entirely on board with all of the conclusions, but I'm very,
very glad he's making them. There's more than enough hand-wringing over whether
technology and the Internet make us antisocial, big tech companies invade our
privacy, and so on. We need more truly deep criticism like Lanier's.

He's not alone, either. There's a growing chorus of writers like
[Evgeny Morozov](http://www.evgenymorozov.com/),
[George Packer](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_packer),
and even geek hero
[Bruce Sterling](http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2013/04/text-of-sxsw2013-closing-remarks-by-bruce-sterling/)
questioning the tech community's values. All powerful voices, all important
contributions.

Apart from his thesis, Lanier throws off a _bon mot_
[near the end of the book](http://books.google.com/books?id=IF8weQd7UXkC&pg=PA181&dq=generational+shift+jaron+lanier&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Cuq1UeabD9CKqQHan4GgDw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=generational%20shift%20jaron%20lanier&f=true)
that has stuck with me:

I suspect that many societal shifts like gay marriage and text messaging happen
not because we change our minds and accept them, one by one, but because those
of us who reject them gradually die off. It's morbid, but in a sense, it's just
"can't teach an old dog new tricks" writ large.

If that's true, it would mean many shifts happen over a fairly predictable
period of time. When a new idea reaches critical mass, the current generation of
adolescents and young adults accepts it. Their parents don't, but as they grow
older and begin to be marginalized, society as a whole tilts toward the younger
generation and accepts the change. So societal shifts should take two
generations or so, plus or minus a generation.

This is an oversimplification, of course. It ignores all sorts of other factors,
such as geography and regional differences. Still, it's a compelling idea, and
it begs Lanier's question. Lifespan has consistently increased over the last
couple hundred years, as has childbearing age. If people are living longer and
having kids later, generations themselves are lasting longer and spreading out
more, which would mean societal shifts are also taking longer.

Is that true? Probably. Should we care? Probably not. The change is pretty
small, all things considered. If it takes us a couple years longer to accept gay
marriage than we did racial integration fifty years ago, that won't matter much
in the grand scheme of things. Still, it's fun to think about.
