For a long time, our cafeteria at work didn't serve dinner on Fridays. Most
people left early on Friday anyway, so it only made sense.

A few years back, [Nathan](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~nstoll/) and I
found ourselves without dinner plans one Friday night, so we headed down to
[Fiesta Del
Mar](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&sll=41.058393,1.017017&sspn=0.007645,0.006931&q=%22fiesta+del+mar%22+near+94043&ie=UTF8&latlng=37405567,-122077468,5511196397270782685)
for margaritas and chimichangas. They were good, so we went back the next
Friday. And the next. And the next.

After a while, we got antsy about the lack of variety, so we branched out to
other Mexican restaurants. Other people heard about the fledgling tradition, and
soon we had a full-blown event that drew 8-10 people each week.
