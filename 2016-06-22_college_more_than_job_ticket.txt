College is more than a job ticket

It's become fashionable recently to second guess college. The ROI no longer works: [it's too expensive](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-college-tuition-in-the-USA-so-expensive) and [doesn't guarantee you a good job](). [It's elitist](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/opinion/colleges-and-elitism.html) and [out of touch with reality](). [Student debt is predatory and out of control.](http://www.ted.com/talks/sajay_samuel_how_college_loans_exploit_students_for_profit) Anyway, [MOOCs' unbundling model is the future of higher ed](), so we might as well get on board, right?

That all may be true, but I think it's too narrow a view. There's a corollary to ["you can't optimize what you don't measure"](https://www.beaconize.com/2016/03/10/metrics-kpis-measured-optimized-for-it/): measurement can give you tunnel vision. When we can measure something, we tend do it everywhere. We collect the results, compare them, and make judgments. If X is 2 and Y is 4, then Y is obviously better. If X is -2 and Y is -3, then they must both be bad. Math doesn't lie!

It does lie, though, when X and Y aren't numbers. You can collect X University grads' incomes, divide by tuition, and compare to College Y, but that doesn't make either one a simple financial investment to optimize to get the best salary return.

College is an experience. It's four of the most critical years of your life: when you learn to be an adult. You figure out what to eat, what to drink, when to go to sleep and when to wake up. You manage your time (or not), juggle priorities (or not), make commitments, and break them. You find substances, wonderful horrible tempting substances, and everything that goes with them. You make friends and significant others, some more significant than others.

Usually, you learn all this first by making mistakes and doing it wrong. No matter how mature we all were, every one of us slept through the History 101 final and flunked, or jumped into bed with someone we knew would break our heart, or woke up in a bush with no pants and the mother of all hangovers.

You can do all this without college, of course, but the real world is unforgiving, and college has training wheels. Advisors, RAs, dorms, cafeterias, and built in health care make for a forgiving place to learn to "adult." Drunk bicycling is a lot less dangerous than drunk driving, and a hell of a lot more entertaining. Classes are the perfect practice for jobs. Hate one? Fail another? Start fresh next semester, older and wiser and still in the same dorm and meal plan.

Of course, there are all sorts of problems with this. The biggest may be that it's unequal. This kind of protected safe space depends on niceties like on campus housing, student advisors, and extracurricular activities, which all cost money. They may be standard at expensive top tier schools, and somewhat common at other four year universities, but not so much at affordable state schools and community colleges.

I think a lot about [how to help my daughter prepare for the real world](/2015-06-04_what-doesnt-kill-my-baby). I catch her if she's about to fall of the bed, but I also show her the edge, let her look down, and say, "See? Far down! If you fall, it'll hurt!" Sometimes I even let her fall on her butt, not far, just enough to notice.

My college gave me the exact same kind of "real world training wheels" that I try to give my daughter. The degree helped me get a job, sure, and the classical education made me a better person, but most of all, I treasure the spaceit gave me to grow. College is more than an investment measured in dollars; it's a critical transition from childhood to adulthood. Don't give that up.
