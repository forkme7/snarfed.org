It's become fashionable recently to second guess college. [The ROI no longer works](http://sites.ed.gov/ous/2013/07/weighing-the-cost-and-value-of-a-college-decision/): [it's too expensive](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-college-tuition-in-the-USA-so-expensive) and [doesn't guarantee you a good job](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21600131-too-many-degrees-are-waste-money-return-higher-education-would-be-much-better). [It's elitist](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/opinion/colleges-and-elitism.html) and [out of touch with reality](http://time.com/100748/new-college-grads-are-about-to-get-a-major-reality-check/). [Student debt is predatory and out of control.](http://www.ted.com/talks/sajay_samuel_how_college_loans_exploit_students_for_profit) Anyway, [MOOCs' unbundling model is the future of higher ed](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anant-agarwal/unbundled-reimagining-higher-education_b_4414048.html), so we might as well get on board, right?

That all may be true, but I think it's too narrow. There's a corollary to ["you can't optimize what you don't measure"](https://www.beaconize.com/2016/03/10/metrics-kpis-measured-optimized-for-it/): measurement can give you tunnel vision. You can collect X University grads' incomes, divide by tuition, and compare to College Y, but that doesn't mean you can reduce either one to a simple financial investment you optimize to get the best salary.

College is an experience. It's one of the most critical periods of your life: when you become an adult. You learn what to eat, what to drink, when to go to sleep and when to wake up. You manage your time (or not), juggle priorities (or not), make commitments and break them. You find substances, wonderful horrible tempting substances. You make friends and significant others, some more significant and some...um...less.

Most of us do this by making mistakes. No matter how mature we were already, every one of us slept through the History 101 final and flunked, or jumped into bed with someone we knew would break our heart, or woke up in a bush with no pants and the mother of all hangovers.

You can do this without college, of course, but the real world is harsh, and college has training wheels. Advisors, RAs, dorms, cafeterias, and built in health care make for a forgiving place to learn to "adult." Drunk bicycling is a lot less dangerous than drunk driving. Classes are the perfect practice for jobs. Hated one? Failed the midterm? Start fresh next semester, older and wiser and still in the same dorm and meal plan.

Sadly, one big flaw with these safety nets is that they're unequal. On campus housing, student advisors, and extracurricular activities all cost money. They may be standard at expensive top tier schools, but not at smaller state schools and community colleges. Maybe we should [vote for Bernie next time](https://berniesanders.com/issues/its-time-to-make-college-tuition-free-and-debt-free/).

I think a lot about [how to prepare my daughter for the real world](/2015-06-04_what-doesnt-kill-my-baby). I catch her if she's about to fall of the bed, but I also show her the edge, let her look down, and say, "See? If you fall, it'll hurt!" Sometimes I even let her fall a bit - not far, just enough to notice.

My college gave me the same kind of real world training wheels. The degree helped me get a job, sure, and the classical education made me a better person and citizen, but I treasure the safe space it gave me to grow. College is more than a financial investment. It's a critical transition from childhood to adulthood. Don't give that up.
