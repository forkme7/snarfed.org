College is more than a job ticket

It's become fashionable recently to second guess college. The ROI no longer works: [it's too expensive](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-college-tuition-in-the-USA-so-expensive) and [doesn't guarantee you a good job](). [It's elitist](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/opinion/colleges-and-elitism.html) and [out of touch with reality](). [Student debt is predatory and out of control.](http://www.ted.com/talks/sajay_samuel_how_college_loans_exploit_students_for_profit) Anyway, [MOOCs' unbundling model is the future of higher ed](), so we might as well get on board, right?

That all may be true, but I think it's too narrow a view. There's a corollary to ["you can't optimize what you don't measure"](): [measurements can give you tunnel vision](). When we can measure something, we tend do it everywhere. We collect the results, compare them, and make judgments. If X is 2 and Y is 4, then Y is obviously better. If X is -2 and Y is -3, then they must both be bad. Math doesn't lie!

It does lie, though, when X and Y aren't numbers. You can collect the incomes for X University's grads and divide them by their tuition, you can do the same for College Y and compare them, but that doesn't make either one a simple financial investment that you optimize to get the best salary return.

College is an experience. It's four years of your life, during one of its most critical periods: when you learn to be an adult. You choose what you eat, what you drink, when you go to sleep and when you wake up. You manage your time (or not), juggle priorities (or not), take on commitments and break them. You find substances, wonderful horrible tempting substances, and everything that goes with them. You find friends and significant others, some more significant than others.

You learn to do all this by making mistakes and doing it wrong first. No matter how mature we all were, every one of us slept through the History 101 final and flunked, or jumped into bed with someone we knew would break our heart, or woke up in a bush with no pants and the mother of all hangovers.

You can do all this without college, of course, but the real world is unforgiving, and college has training wheels. Advisors, RAs, dorms, cafeterias, and built in health care make for a forgiving place to learn to "adult." Drunk bicycling is a lot less dangerous than drunk driving, and a hell of a lot more entertaining. Classes are the perfect practice for jobs. Hate one? Fail another? Start fresh next semester, older and wiser and still in the same dorm and meal plan.

There are all sorts of problems with this argument, of course. The biggest may be that it's unequal.
