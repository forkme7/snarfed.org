[`unixify.sh`](https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/master/unixify.sh) is a simple shell
script I use to sanitize files people send me, often from other operating
systems.

It cleans up file names by removing most punctuation and converting spaces to
underscores and upper case to lower case. For example, it converts
*Foo, Bar, & Baz (Special).JPEG* to *foo_bar_and_baz_special.jpg*.

It also re-compresses images with [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/),
removes carriage returns from DOS and Windows style CRLF line endings, and
converts Microsoft Word documents to plain text with
[antiword](http://www.winfield.demon.nl/).

It supports dry runs via the `-n` flag, which just prints what would be done
instead of actually doing it.
