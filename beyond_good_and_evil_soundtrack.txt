The music from the [Beyond Good & Evil](http://beyondgoodevil.com/) soundtrack,
written and performed by
[Christophe Heral](http://mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,129873/),
is incredible. It has haunting ballades, adrenaline-filled anthems, and even
some surprisingly good French hip-hop. It was praised unanimously in
[reviews](http://gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/561645.asp) as one of the best
parts of the game.

Unfortunately, you can't buy it anywhere. Due to a flood of fans clamoring for
it, though, you _can_ download it. Ubisoft released it
<strike>on
[Nintendo Insider](http://nintendoinsider.com/) as a collection of 31
[freely](http://nintendoinsider.com/site/EpZVyAAAZEhBjcpQpA.php)
[downloadable](http://nintendoinsider.com/site/EpZypFAVlVWQAxqHsA.php)
[mp3s](http://nintendoinsider.com/site/EpZlppyZVEShihRvCx.php).</strike>
Nintendo Insider is now gone, but
[the MP3s are still available here](http://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/beyond-good-evil).

Also, if you're a purist, and you own the PC version of the game, you can use
Rahly's [bfextractor](http://www.terrygoodkind.net/~rahly/bgae.php) tool to
[extract](http://forums.adventuregamers.com/showpost.php?s=47dff0cde4ff07670491a29882eab57b&p=28031&postcount=10)
the individual music tracks directly from the CD.
