CodeCon!

<p class="right"><img class="shadow" src="/codecon.png" /></p>

Update: I've posted [my notes on the projects](/CodeCon_2004) and a [photo
album](/codecon_2004_pictures).

I'll be at [CodeCon](http://codecon.info/) (at [Club NV
](http://sfclubs.com/club-nv.html) in SF) Saturday and Sunday. I'll be
representing [Google](http://google.com/), since we're a sponsor, but more
importantly I'll be there to hear some really impressive speakers. **If you'll
be at CodeCon, stop me and say hi!** I'll be decked out in a black Google fleece
and a Google laptop bag, and I'll probably be asking everyone within earshot for
their resume. :P
