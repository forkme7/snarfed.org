[huffduff-video](http://huffduff-video.snarfed.org/), my latest side project,
lets you take the audio from videos on YouTube, Vimeo, and
[many more sites](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html) and send
it to [Huffduffer](http://huffduffer.com/). Just
[grab the bookmarklet](http://huffduff-video.snarfed.org/), click it next time
you find a video that you want to listen to, and it should show up in your
podcast app automatically!

It's pretty bare bones, but it does the trick. Thanks to
[youtube-dl](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) for doing all of the heavy
lifting, [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/) for building the wonderful
[Huffduffer](http://huffduffer.com/), and interviewers and speakers everywhere
for providing so many great videos to huffduff!
