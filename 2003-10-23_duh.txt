Duh

Guess what I did about half an hour ago?

    blaize:~> rm -rf \*

Yes, you read that right. Sorry for the unabashed geekiness...windows users,
imagine if you dragged My Computer to the Recycle Bin, and then emptied the
Recycle Bin.

Yeah. Sigh...

Luckily, I set up automatic backups a while ago, so I didn't lose anything I
actually care about. Well, that's not quite true. I lost an archive of a year or
two's worth of email from a few years ago, which would have been nice to have,
if only for nostalgia. Oh, and I lost all my MP3s. But most of those are freely
(read: legally) available on the web, so I'm not too worried.

Moral of the story? Backups are your friend, especially if, like me, you're
dumb. :P
