[Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy/), my little [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/)
side project, hit a milestone yesterday: 1000 users! Congratulations
[Brett Glisson](https://www.brid.gy/googleplus/101184744082016026460), you win
the prize!

1000 is not a big number, of course. We're not in viral,
[growth hacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking),
[customer acquisition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_acquisition_cost)
land any more, Toto, and that's fine with me. I built Bridgy to scratch my own
itch, in fine open source (and IndieWeb) tradition. I only polished it and
launched it publicly because I thought other people might have the same itch.

I enjoy a good navel gaze as much as the next developer, and milestones like
this are always a good excuse, so here are some graphs. They have pretty colors!

First, user growth. I wouldn't call it exponential, but it's continuing at a
steady clip.

Many people sign up for more than one social network - Facebook, Twitter,
etc. - so it's technically just 1000 _accounts_, not users. I'd guess there are
only 400-500 distinct users. It's not easy to tell the difference automatically,
though, and 1000 is a nice round number, so I'm going with it.

On a related note, if the unexpected happens and the trickle suddenly becomes a
flood, I'm pretty confident it will scale. App Engine does most of the heavy
lifting, and webmention sending and silo polling are intentionally serialized so
that they degrade gracefully. If a million people signed up overnight, the
workload would remain (roughly) constant. The only part I'd probably need to
rewrite is - of all things - the [users page](https://www.brid.gy/users).

Now, the stuff Bridgy actually _does_. Note that the first graph is log scale,
since I threw in everything and the kitchen sink. Tufte would probably have a
fit.

That's the candy up front; now it's time for us to eat our vegetables. What
lessons have I learned so far? What has building Bridgy taught me? Honestly, I'm
not sure. I can't think of anything particularly interesting or insightful. We
need a balanced meal, though, so here are some thoughts:

* The "scratch your own itch" thing really works. I always knew what to build
next, and how to prioritize, based on what I wanted for myself. More
interestingly, the major features I added later - [Bridgy Publish]() and
[webmentions for blogs]() - weren't as strong itches for me personally,
and correspondingly, each one has seen less and less uptake.

On a related note, [Kyle Mahan](https://kylewm.com/) and
[Emma Kuo](http://notenoughneon.com/) rock for implementing two of my biggest
personal itches,
[posse post discovery](http://indiewebcamp.com/posse-post-discovery) and
[photo publishing](https://www.brid.gy/about#picture). Thanks guys!

* I want users to have a good experience, but I don't want to do tech support.
When someone reports a problem or asks a question, I try to find and fix the
root cause, add automation or hints, or at the very least update
[the docs](https://www.brid.gy/about) so that the next user won't have the same
problem. It's not perfect, but I think it's helping...

* ...or it could be that for most users, Bridgy is fire and forget. They sign
up, refresh their user page a few times, maybe skim the docs, and then never
come back. If they're set up right, they don't need to. Comments and retweets
and +1s start showing up on their web site automatically. This is my favorite
kind of UX: _none at all_...which is good for me, since I'm a godawful UX
designer.

Contributors are still doing
[substantial new development](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/240), and
I've pushed out a steady trickle of tweaks and bug fixes for a while, but that's
slowed down recently. None of the
[remaining feature requests](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues) are above
my itch threshold, so they may not happen anytime soon. I happily accept pull
requests, but otherwise, Bridgy is basically on ops autopilot right now.

Keep it up, Bridgy! Here's to 1000 more!
