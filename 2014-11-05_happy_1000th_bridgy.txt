[Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy/), my little [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/)
side project, hit a milestone yesterday: 1000 users! Congratulations
[Brett Glisson](https://www.brid.gy/googleplus/101184744082016026460), you win!

OK, it's technically just 1000 _accounts_, not users per se, since many people
sign up for more than one social network - Facebook, Twitter, etc. I'd guess
there are only 400-500 distinct users. It's not always easy to tell which
different accounts have the same person behind them, though, and 1000 is a nice
round number, so I'm going with it. Happy 1000th, Bridgy!

To be sure, this is not big. We're not in viral
[growth hacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking)
[CAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_acquisition_cost) land any more,
Toto... which is just fine with me. I built Bridgy to scratch my own itch, in
fine open source (and IndieWeb) tradition. I only polished it up and launched it
publicly because it was just enough work to maybe warrant saving other people
the same effort.

It's customary in "look how far we've come!" post like this to wax lyrical about
lessons learned along the way. Honestly, I doubt I've learned anything truly
insightful, but I did notice a few things that might count.
