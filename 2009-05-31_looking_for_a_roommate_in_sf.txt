Looking for a roommate in SF?

I'm thinking about getting an apartment in San Francisco for a bit. I only
expect to be there weekday nights, probably Sunday through Wednesday, plus the
occasional weekend night or two. I've been looking at furnished one bedrooms,
but it'd be fun to room with a friend. [Drop me a line](/about) if
you're interested!

I used to live in SF, and I loved it, but the commute slowly wore me down, so
I eventually [moved to Palo Alto](/2004-12-02_suburbia_ho). I still
love living here, but we moved
[our team](/2008-04-07_google_app_engine_launched) to the
[SF office](/directions_to_google) a while back, and the commute
is wearing me down again.

Don't worry! I have roots in the peninsula, so I'm not entirely moving. I'm
definitely ready to make some quality of life improvements, though. Getting
rid of the daily commute will be a big first step.
