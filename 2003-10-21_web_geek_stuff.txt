Web geek stuff

Warning: unless you like silly technical web stuff, stop reading now. :P

I've added a few little features to [SnipSnap](/SnipSnap), the program
that powers snarfed.org. Here are the writeups for each feature:

[http://snipsnap.org/space/virtual+host+redirection](http://snipsnap.org/space/virtual+host+redirection)

[http://snipsnap.org/space/register+without+email](http://snipsnap.org/space/register+without+email)

Also, check out a really interesting one [maulik](/maulik) wrote:

Of course, if you've looked at the [pictures](/pictures), you're already
familiar with the [album](/album) macro we wrote.
