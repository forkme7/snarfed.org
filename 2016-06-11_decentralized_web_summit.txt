I spent the last few days at the
[Decentralized Web Summit](http://www.decentralizedweb.net/), a small gathering
of like-minded hackers, thinkers, and activists from all over. I don't go to many
conferences, but this one was inspiring and exciting.
[Even the mainstream press noticed.](http://www.decentralizedweb.net/press/)
I'll see if I can describe why.

I spent some time in the peer-to-peer community during the first dot com boom. I
[hung out](/2007-04-29_p2p-hackers_san_francisco_meetup)
[with the](2005-12-11_p2p-hackers_san_francisco_meetup)
[p2p-hackers](http://lists.zooko.com/mailman/listinfo/p2p-hackers)
[and](/codecon_2006_notes) [CodeCon](/codecon_2005_notes) folks, co-created a
[toy P2P network](/p4)
[and contributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JXTA) [to others](/windows_p2p),
idolized [Nullsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullsoft) and
[Bram Cohen](http://bramcohen.com/) and
[anonymous remailers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_remailer), and
generally yearned to be free of The Man in the middle. By the time BitTorrent
hit it big, P2P seemed unstoppable, even
[inevitable](http://kk.org/books/the-inevitable/).

It wasn't, of course, but recently there's been a resurgence of interest. The
financial crisis, the NSA spying revelations, and online power concentrated into
a few big [silos](https://indieweb.org/silo) rallied the internet's
venerable elders, [Vint Cerf](http://research.google.com/pubs/author32412.html)
and [Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/)
and [Brewster Kahle](https://archive.org/about/bios.php)
and [Mitchell Baker](https://blog.mozilla.org/press/bios/mitchell-baker/).
([And Richard Stallman!](/2016-06-08_17841#comment-2599122)) They turned over a
few rocks and found the
P2P [cypherpunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) keeping the flame
alive, developing projects like [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/)
and [Dat](http://dat-data.com/) and [Tor](https://torproject.org/) and falling
all over themselves to
sanctify [Satoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) and create
the [Next Big Blockchain](https://ethereum.org/).

The MC called us [OGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_gangster) and
New Gs, drawn together by a common desire to
[redecentralize](http://redecentralize.org/) the web. We discussed the past,
present, and future, compared projects and protocols - including
[my own little ditty on the IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/events/2016-06-09-dwebsummit-indieweb)
([video](https://archive.org/details/DecentralizedWeb20160609pt1?start=8826),
 [slides](/assets/player/KeynoteDHTMLPlayer.html#2)) -
and debated what to do next. It was great.

My first big takeaway was that the community seems to be maturing. Just by
organizing the summit, the elders showed that they were paying attention and
cared. That wasn't really true last time around. And given TimBL's position atop
the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) and Brewster's irrepressable energy for
catalyzing action, that definitely matters.

Second, there was a _lot_ of talk about real world problems like UX and
monetization. People widely acknowledged that P2P projects still aren't usable
or accessible enough and don't always address real user problems, which may
be why they haven't hit the mainstream yet, Skype and BitTorrent notwithstanding.

Also, despite the usual appeals to micropayments and transaction fees, most
people admitted that we still don't know how to sustainably pay for systems
without centralized control. The honesty was very encouraging. The first step is
admitting we have a problem!

Finally - and
[feel free to take a drink here](https://twitter.com/benjojo12/status/681818638362492929) -
the blockchain. I'd grokked it at a high level before, but I came away from
[#DWebsummit](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DWebSummit) with a newfound
appreciation.

Yes, it's an entirely new
[consensus algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_algorithm), and as
[Mike Burrows famously declared](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/Can-anyone-confirm-the-Paxos-quote-supposedly-by-Mike-Burrows),
those don't come around very often. More importantly though, it's the first
_open membership_ consensus algorithm we've ever seen.

Before Bitcoin and the blockchain, all consensus algorithms required a closed
group of participants. They came from the distributed systems community, from
people who built and ran self-contained clusters of servers they owned and
controlled. Bitcoin changed all that. _Anyone_ can mine a bitcoin, or send one,
and those transactions are just as consistent and durable as a
[Paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_%28computer_science%29) round or
[ZAB](https://distributedalgorithm.wordpress.com/2015/06/20/architecture-of-zab-zookeeper-atomic-broadcast-protocol/)
broadcast.

This is pretty huge. The internet depends on centralized human organizations
like [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/),
[CAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority), and
[Tier 1 networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network), and they've
worked surprisingly well for a surprisingly long time, but failures like
[CA compromises](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/10/28/1954201/four-cas-have-been-compromised-since-june)
and [BGP hijacking](http://research.dyn.com/2008/02/pakistan-hijacks-youtube-1/)
have exposed their inherent flaws. Projects like
[Certificate Transparency](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/) are
laudable, but they're really just band-aids. They can contain damage, but they
can't prevent it entirely.

Human organizations regularly do superhuman things, and they may still be the
right long term approach here. We've just never had a real alternative before.
Now we do, and that's pretty damn cool.

Don't worry, I'm not dropping everything to create a cryptocurrency or drum up
VC funding for a blockchain startup. I have downloaded a handful of papers to
read, though, and I may drop by Friday lunch at the Archive now and then. DWeb renewed my interest in
[the once and future decentralized web](http://tantek.com/presentations/2014/05/indieweb/),
and that's a good thing.
