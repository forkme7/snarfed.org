Google App Engine Launch Party

After [launching our latest project](/2008-04-07_google_app_engine_launched), [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/), we had a small launch party. We invited press and industry people to the [official announcement](http://code.google.com/campfire/), so we were able to celebrate at the party with just family and friends. Thanks to [Circolo](http://circolosf.com) for hosting us, and congratulations again to the team!
