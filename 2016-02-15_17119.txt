Skiing unlit runs after dark&nbsp; - they were physically open, but probably still "closed" - was a hell of an experience. We couldn't really see the snow, so it felt like skiing blind, but the runs were freshly groomed, so there wasn't much actual danger. The runs were challenging enough to put us into flow, but without seeing anything, and without other people, it was a whole new sensory experience.

It felt surreal, dreamlike, eerily peaceful. Like floating through the set of a horror movie after it's wrapped and the squibs are spent and the monster costumes are all hung up back in wardrobe. Or like a great high that might turn into a bad trip, but might not. Hard to describe, but highly recommended if you're a good skier.
