The No Network Effect

It's tax season! At least, for those of us in the US. If you're reading this,
you probably have to pay taxes. You don't have a choice; it's required by law.
Beyond taxes though, how you manage your money is up to you. You can invest in
the stock market, for example, but you could also buy bonds, or real estate or
pork belly futures or [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/). Stocks are strictly
optional.

Required and optional may seem to cover all the bases, but there's actually a
third class of activities. Take credit cards. They're not required by any law,
natural or man-made. You can survive without them - I've done it - but it's a
pretty limited life. Modern society takes them for granted more and more every
day. Ever tried to buy a plane ticket with cash? It's not easy. Travelling in
general is difficult, as is building a credit rating. Participating in the
Internet is basically impossible. Even I couldn't truly escape credit cards; I
just used [disposable ones](privacy_through_prepaid_credit_cards) that didn't
need any of my personal information. Credit cards aren't explicitly required
these days, but they might as well be.

Don't worry, this isn't yet another
[privacy](2011-08-03_why_im_weird_about_privacy)
[rant](2012-09-22_revisiting_why_im_weird_about_privacy) or fake credit card
scheme. Instead, I'd like to talk about this illusion of choice, these _de
facto_ requirements that are optional in theory but not in practice. This
problem is known as the No Network Effect, a term
[Moxie Marlinspike](http://thoughtcrime.org/) popularized in his
[talk at Defcon 18](http://privacy-pc.com/news/changing-threats-to-privacy-moxie-marlinspike-on-privacy-threats.html).

Did you catch that last part? _The choices start out very simple...but over
time...they expand until they become a choice to participate in society or not._
That's the essence of the no network effect. These _de facto_ requirements are
an insidious set of shadow laws, as powerful as real laws but exempt from the
checks and balances and public discourse inherent to representative democracy.

[Ted Kaczynski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski), aka the Unabomber,
discussed this problem in his infamous and surprisingly lucid
[manifesto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski#Industrial_Society_and_Its_Future):

To be clear, neither Marlinspike nor Kaczynski see this as a conspiracy theory.
_De facto_ requirements don't usually have power-hungry tycoons pulling the
strings behind the scenes. People may take advantage of them to profit, or gain
power, but that's about as sinister as it gets. Hell, most of the time we don't
even see them coming. For every Facebook with a Mark Zuckerberg at the helm
hoping for a billion users, there are ten innovations just as big that no one
expected to change the world. The inventors behind the printing press,
electricity, automobiles, the Internet, and cell phones all aimed them at niche
markets. Their ubiquity was unplanned.

This makes the no network effect all the more insidious. If it was just a few
bad apples creating _de facto_ requirements, we could throw them in jail. More
likely, if it was a bad system, or bad incentives, we could push for reform. The
culprit isn't any of those, though; it's progress itself. We're constantly
coming up with new innovations, discarding the ones we don't like and adopting
the ones we do. Short of bombing everyone back to the stone age, there's no good
way to stop progress.

There's another problem too. By way of comparison, laws are the main kind of
explicit requirement that apply to everyone. They have their flaws, but they
also have a powerful strength: they promote dialog. When Congress considers
passing a new bill, we know we'll have to obey it, so we have a vested interest.
We pay attention, we debate, we lobby our representatives, we vote for
candidates who promise to vote for it or against it.

The no network effect is different. When we talk about the drawbacks of credit
cards, or cell phones, or any _de facto_ requirement, someone always says “If
you don't like it, don't get one. No one's making you,” and with one fell swoop,
they've taken the teeth out of the debate. We nod sagely at the wisdom of paying
the entire balance each month, or muting our phone to focus on people we care
about, but we never return to the question of whether to adopt in the first
place. That question is dead. “No one's making you” killed it.

Occasionally, we meet someone who cut up all of their credit cards, or never got
a cell phone, and there's a flurry of excitement. “Wow, that's so cool!” “I've
always wanted to do that.” “Is it the privacy thing for you? Are you trying to
avoid debt?” The no network effect may get a brief nod, but it soon gives way to
logistics. “Wait, so how do you do reserve a hotel room?” “I bet I could give up
my phone, if not for texting.” “Have you heard of
[phone stacking](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/the-phone-stacking-game-picture_n_1929162.html)?
That helps, right?” Any chance for a critical discussion of our adoption _en
masse_ is long gone.

It's not all bad. For all their drawbacks, we adopt new things because they have
benefits, and we think those benefits outweigh their drawbacks.
[Kevin Kelly](http://kk.org/) highlights one particular effect of this in his
thoughtful book
[What Technology Wants](http://www.kk.org/books/what-technology-wants.php). _De
facto_ requirements may reduce our effective freedom by one choice - the choice
to adopt - but they also _expand_ our freedom by offering us new choices we
didn't have before:

> [M]ost people of the world...gravitate toward technology because they recognize
> that they have more freedoms when they are empowered with it. They (that is, we)
> realistically weigh the fact that yes, indeed, some options are closed off when
> adopting new technology, but many others are opened, so that the net gain is an
> increase in freedom, choices, and possibilities.

Kelly goes as far as to rebut Kaczynski explicitly:

> For 25 years he lived in a type of self-enforced solitary confinement...He may
> have personally been content with his limited world, but overall his choices
> were very constrained, although he had unshackled freedom within those limited
> choices - sort of like, “You are free to hoe the potatoes any hour of the day
> you want.” Kaczynski confused latitude with freedom. He enjoyed great liberty
> within limited choices, but he erroneously believed this parochial freedom was
> superior to an expanding number of alternative choices that may offer less
> latitude within each choice. An exploding circle of choices encompasses much
> more actual freedom than simply increasing the latitude within limited choices.

Kelly's argument resonates with me, but I still worry about the no network
effect. First off, it's global, not local. When society unconsciously generates a
_de facto_ requirement, it applies to everyone, including those who may not like
it or aren't ready to handle it. Do you find shopping irresistible when you can
put everything on credit? Do you hate that you constantly pull out your phone to
check email, or Facebook? Too bad. Unless you're ready to make some big
sacrifices and take a few steps in the Unabomber's direction, you're stuck with
your credit card and cell phone.

Another problem is how we choose what to adopt, or more accurately, how we
_don't_ choose. There's no no committee that judges new developments, no single
authority that decides, “Email? Yes. Segway? No.” Instead, we get the wisdom of
crowds, the invisible hand of the free market. Unfortunately, just like the
quarterly reporting drumbeat dooms Wall Street to perpetual shortsightedness,
our freedom to adopt biases us toward the short term too. We see something
shiny, it gives us a few quick dopamine boosts, and we jump on board. The
unintended consequences don't appear until years later, and by then the new
hotness has become so ingrained that we don't realize it's at fault.

<img class="right shadow" src="amish_couple.jpg" />

The Amish may understand this better than anyone. They've adopted surprisingly
modern innovations like GMO crops, fiberglass, folding bikes, and LED lights,
but they've famously rejected credit cards, television, the electrical grid, and
many others. Their adoption process is illuminating, and very different.

Individuals in Amish communities don't get to adopt anything on their own.
Instead, the local bishops choose a guinea pig and let them try it under close
supervision. They watch the results and evaluate them against their core values
of strengthening families and distancing from the outside world. If the trial
seems promising, the bishops may expand it, iterating in careful cycles that
[agile development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
devotees would admire.

Can we learn from them? Maybe. To start, they clearly don't believe in the
[Precautionary Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle),
a style of regulation popular in Europe that tries to foresee and safeguard
against every possible side effect before approving anything. The Amish don't
believe they can predict the future; instead, they get their hands dirty and try
new things in the real world to discover their full effects. (I think they're
right.)

I also admire them for taking the long view. They know it often takes a
generation or two to see the full effects of adopting something, so they watch
for years, sometimes decades, reserving the right to pull the plug at any
time. I appreciate how deliberately they approach the process, identifying their
core values up front and using them as measuring sticks.

Having said all that, I don't think the Amish have actually solved the no
network effect problem. They just sidestep it altogether, trading _de facto_
requirements (and prohibitions) for explicit ones.

In the end, the no network effect may solve itself.
[Alan Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) famously defined technology as
“anything that was invented after you were born,” and the same may be true of
_de facto_ requirements. A handful of us may agonize over credit cards, or cell
phones, but almost no one wants to opt out of modern plumbing or electricity.
Every generation may have its set of angst-inducing developments, but if the
goalposts of progress keep moving forward, the next generation will take those
developments for granted, worrying instead about an entirely new crop of
changes.

This is the “privacy is dead, get over it” school of thought, which argues that
the relentless march of progress makes some things inevitable, both good (e.g.
[social politics](2013-04-02_othering)) and bad (_de facto_ requirements). I
don't know if that's true, but if it is, I can probably get behind it. I
[don't really believe in free will](2012-08-15_if_theres_no_free_will_then_what),
after all. On the other hand, I did finally give in and get a cell phone a few
years ago, but I still don't have a credit card. So much for _de facto_
requirements!
