I was lucky enough to see the final round of
[Stanford Idol](http://absoluteidol.stanford.edu/) tonight, and...wow. It was
really, _really_ entertaining.
[100 Stanford students](http://daily.stanford.org/tempo?page=content&id=15845&repository=0001_article)
auditioned, 40 were chosen for the quarterfinals, and
[eight made it to the finals](http://daily.stanford.edu/daily/servlet/tempo?page=content&id=16428&repository=0001_article).
There was the over-the-top diva, the soulful big guy, the sultry vixen, the R&B
singer-slash-dancer, the heartthrob, and most importantly, the Kelly Clarkson
and Justin Guarini lookalikes. They even had three "celebrity" judges, two
overly energetic hosts, and a blooper reel from the auditions.

Sounds cheesy, but I actually had a great time. Sure, it was a standard formula,
but they managed to make it their own, and it was clear that everyone was having
a lot of fun. It also didn't hurt that the audience was excited...and _loud_.

There was one problem, though. All three judges were way too nice. Where was
Simon Cowell? Where were the harsh put-downs? The breathtakingly rude snap
judgments? That's half the fun, right? Ah well. I guess there's always next
year.
