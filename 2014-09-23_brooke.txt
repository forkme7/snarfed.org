Little Brooke, our new daughter, evidently inherited some of her dad's
stubbornness. It took three epic days in the hospital in labor and 4 superhuman
hours of pushing, but she finally arrived at 9:59am yesterday, weighing 6lbs 9oz
and measuring 20" long.

Mom and baby are both tired but doing great. Dad is very happy and very
shellshocked.

It's all downhill from here, right? Right...?
