GDC 2007 Trip Report

<a href="GDC_2007"><img src="gdc2007.jpg"></a>

This was my sixth year at [GDC](http://gdconf.com/), and as always, it's a lot
of fun to take a break for a bit and immerse myself in an entirely different
world.

Like the [last](/GDC_2005) [two](/GDC_2006) years, I've written up
[my thoughts on GDC 2007](/GDC_2007). Enjoy!
