[`import_issues.py`](https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/master/import_issues.py) imports issues from a CSV file into a [Google Code project hosting](http://code.google.com/hosting/) [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/IssueTracker). It uses the [Issue Tracker API](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/IssueTrackerAPI) and authenticates via [OAuth](http://oauth.net/), so it never sees your username or password. [Download it](https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/master/import_issues.py) and try it out!

Usage: `import_issues.py PROJECT FILENAME`

where `PROJECT` is the Google Code project name and `FILENAME` is the CSV file to import.

Example run:

```
$ ./import_issues.py mockfacebook new.csv
Opening a web page in your browser to request access.
Please click the Grant access button.
Importing new.csv into mockfacebook's issue tracker...
Imported 3 issues.
```

The CSV columns are: `title, content, author, status, owner, labels, cc`. Title,
content, and author are required, but the rest are optional, so the file may
have anywhere from 3 to 7 columns. If the file has a header with the column
names above, it will be skipped. Leading and trailing whitespace will be trimmed
from fields. Labels and cc are space- or comma-separated lists of values. If
comma-separated, the entire field must be enclosed in quotes.

Requires [gdata-python-client](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/)
2.0.7 or higher. If you don't already have it, here are commands to download and
install it in the same directory as this script:

```
wget http://gdata-python-client.googlecode.com/files/gdata-2.0.15.tar.gz
tar xzf gdata-2.0.15.tar.gz
ln -s gdata-2.0.15/src/gdata
ln -s gdata-2.0.15/src/atom
```

`import_issues.py` is in the public domain.
