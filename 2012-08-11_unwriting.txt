Unwriting

<p class="right"><img src="/fountain_pen.jpg" /></p>

Usually, I write a blog post by...well, by writing it. I'm going to try
something new this time: I'm going to _not_ write a post. Hell, I'm going to not
write a whole bunch of them.

Like [other](http://paulgraham.com/) [writers](http://www.randsinrepose.com/)
[I](http://www.lostgarden.com/) [admire](http://www.somebits.com/weblog/), I
always have a handful of ideas in the back of my mind that I want to write, and
plan to, but haven't quite figured out exactly what I want to say, or how, or
just haven't found time for yet.

I don't always get around to them. Some issues are well established and widely
discussed, and I'm not sure I can add anything meaningful or new. Some don't
have enough meat on their bones to warrant an essay, even a small one. Some have
too much; an essay isn't enough space to do them justice. Some I lose interest
in, or realize I wasn't so interested in the first place. Some I just can't post
with a straight face.

The backlog is pretty big right now, and when I look at them honestly, I have to
admit that most will never happen. I still like them, though, so I'm going to
post their bare skeletons over the next couple days. No research, no analysis,
no drafts and revisions, no sleeping on it. Just write the idea, post, repeat.

I may never revisit any of them, but that's all the more reason to push them out
of the nest and make space for newer ideas. If any have wings and take off, so
much the better.

Ready? Let's do it.
