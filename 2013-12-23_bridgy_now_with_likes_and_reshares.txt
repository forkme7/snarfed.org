[Brid.gy](https://www.brid.gy/) started by copying social network comments to
your web site, but it hasn't rested on its laurels. It now copies Facebook likes
and shares, Twitter retweets, Google+ +1s and reshares, and Instagram likes too!
[Here are](http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2013/11/28/1/github-repo-collections)

If you're signed up, you've already seen these new additions ramp up over the
last week or so. If you're not, feel free to

all an [Indie Web!](http://indiewebcamp.com/)
