We heard John Adams and Mason Bates premier their new pieces last night at one of SFS's last American Mavericks performances. I love both Adams and Bates, and even though I didn't love either of the new pieces, we still had a great time. Anyone else catch the show too?

...which reminds me, I also need to make time to go see Bates spin in his club identity as DJ Masonic.
