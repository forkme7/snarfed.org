Like many people, I buy things online. Unlike many people, I'm a bit of a
privacy freak. I only use [anonymous prepaid debit cards](/space/privacy_through_prepaid_credit_cards), and I don't give out my real name, address, birthdate, or
other personal information. If I'm buying something that needs to be shipped, I
use a mail drop, not my home address.

Of course, most web sites ask for name, address, and phone number whether or not
they need it. Some also check them against the name and address on your credit
card using [AVS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Verification_System).

Regardless, I avoid giving out my information. I've been keeping track of what
can be ignored, what can be faked, and what has to be real on many ecommerce web
sites I've used.
