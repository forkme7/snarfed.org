[Locale Music Plugin](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.snarfed.android.localemusic)
is a plugin for the [Locale](http://www.twofortyfouram.com/) Android app that
plays any song, audio file, or playlist in the default music app. You can
[get it from the Android app store](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.snarfed.android.localemusic).

If there's no available music app, it uses the built in Android media player.
Playlists are only supported on some devices.

It's open source and released into the public domain.
[Download the code](locale_music_plugin.tar.bz2).
