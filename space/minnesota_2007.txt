Minnesota 2007

Nick's parents recently invited the
[PKN](http://keeda.stanford.edu/~kash/kashnick/party-videos.html) slash
[friday dinner](/space/friday+mexican+dinner)
crew to visit their beautiful lake house in Minnesota. We had a blast water
skiing, kayaking, cooking, relaxing, and even running
[Bob Koshnick's standard Sunday morning
run](http://www.mapmyrun.com/run/united-states/ca/detroit-lakes/685365929).
Not for the faint of heart!

The pictures are from

Thanks, Nick!
