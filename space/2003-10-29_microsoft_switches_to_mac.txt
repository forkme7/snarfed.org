Microsoft switches to Mac?

So, guess where this picture was taken?

Yeah, that's right. Microsoft! On their main campus, in Redmond, Washington.
Clearly they must already have Macs in their offices, since they develop Office
(and other programs) for Mac. But still, it's pretty incongruous.

Incidentally, Microsoft [fired the guy who took this
picture](http://www.michaelhanscom.com/eclecticism/2003/10/of_blogging_and.html).
