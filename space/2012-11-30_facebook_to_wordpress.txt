Facebook to WordPress

[facebook_to_wordpress.py](https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/master/facebook_to_wordpress.py)
is a script that copies your [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) posts to a
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) blog of your choice. It helps you take
control over your posts, pictures, and other online memories, following in the
spirit of the [Indie Web movement](2012-07-25_why_i_have_my_own_web_site).

I've used it to copy a number of
[my own Facebook posts](http://www.facebook.com/snarfed.org) to this web site.
Here are a few examples:

  * [Milos](2012-06-26_milos)
  * [Chocolate + infographic = crazy delicious](http://snarfed.org/2012-06-15_chocolate-infographic-crazy-delicious)
  * [Cool looking clouds](2012-08-14_cool-looking-clouds)
  * [Pumpkin carving](2012-10-28_pumpkin-carving)
  * [Best gift wrap and card ever](2012-10-22_best-gift-wrap-and-card-ever)

The script reads one or more Facebook posts in Graph API JSON representation
publishes them to a WordPress blog via XML-RPC. It includes and formats
pictures, locations (ie checkins), links, tagged people, comments, and a link
back to the original post.

You can use Facebook's
[Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer?method=GET&path=212038%3Ffields%3Did%2Cname%2Cposts).
Just follow that link, copy all of the text in the big bottom right pane into a
file, then run `facebook_to_wordpress.py` on that file.

If you see a *â†’* (right arrow) next to `posts` on the left side, that means
click on it,
copy the new text into another file, repeat until the right arrow disappears,
and run `facebook_to_wordpress.py` on that file.


Example usage:

    $ ./facebook_to_wordpress.py http://myblog.com/xmlrpc.php \
        user password < posts.json
    Reading posts from stdin
    Connecting to http://myblog.com/xmlrpc.php as user

Facebook also lets you [download your data](https://www.facebook.com/download/)
as a set of HTML pages and images in a zip file. It's not as useful for
publishing on the web, but if you just want an archive of your data, or if you
want to publish it as static, read-only pages, it's an option.
