I'm a heavy keyboard user, and I [often](emacs_keybindings_in_firefox)
[go](control_arrow_keys_in_rxvt_tcsh_and_emacs)
[to](emacs_keybindings_in_gnu_screens_copy-scrollback_mode)
[great](switch_control_and_caps_lock) [lengths](emacs_page_up_page_down) to set
up consistent keyboard shortcuts in the programs I use.

[Firefox](http://getfirefox.com/) has good keyboard support overall.
[Find as you type](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Searching#w_search-links-only),
for example, lets me select and follow an individual link with just a few
keypresses. Awesome. Still, Firefox has a big UI surface area, so it inevitably
has a few rough keyboard edges.

Enter the [keyconfig](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=72994)
extension, which lets you customize all of the built-in keyboard shortcuts and
add new ones. You can even bind keys to *arbitrary JavaScript*. Brilliant! I
can't believe it took me so long to find it.

Here's a list of the keyboard shortcuts I've modified with keyconfig:

* Disabled Ctrl-B and Ctrl-H for the Bookmark and History sidebars. I often hit
  them accidentally, and there's no corresponding key to *close* the sidebars.
* Likewise, disabled F1 for help. 
* Ctrl-1, -2, and -3 for my mail, calendar, and todo list
  [app tabs](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/what-are-app-tabs) and Ctrl-9
  to
  [go to the last tab](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Keyboard%20shortcuts#w_windows-tabs).
* Ctrl-Shift-S to reload my [userstyles](http://userstyles.org/help/userstyles).
  I use this in my edit/compile/test loop for
  [developing userstyles](my_stylish_userstyle_workflow). Code:
    stylishOverlay.turnOnOff(
      !Components.classes["@mozilla.org/preferences-service;1"].getService(
       Components.interfaces.nsIPrefBranch).getBoolPref("extensions.stylish.styleRegistrationEnabled"))
* F9 to focus the page. Helpful when you try to scroll the page, but the focus
  is on the URL bar or elsewhere. Code: `_content.focus();`
* TODO: key to reload the proxy.
