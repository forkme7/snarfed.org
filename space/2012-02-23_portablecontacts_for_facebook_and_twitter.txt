PortableContacts for Facebook and Twitter

I've just published
[portablecontacts-unofficial](https://github.com/snarfed/portablecontacts-unofficial),
a stand-in [PortableContacts](http://portablecontacts.net/) server for major
sites that don't implement it themselves. It currently has implementations for
Facebook and Twitter, deployed at these endpoints:

<style type="text/css">
ul {
  font-size: large;
  list-style: none;
}
</style>

  * [`facebook-poco.appspot.com`](https://facebook-poco.appspot.com/)
  * [`twitter-poco.appspot.com`](https://twitter-poco.appspot.com/)

They complement the
[unofficial WebFinger providers](2012-01-16_webfinger_for_facebook_and_twitter)
I published last month, which I've updated to include `Link` elements pointing
to the new PortableContacts endpoints.

Both are just little side projects, and they may not be hugely useful on their
own, but together they're another step toward implementing
[OStatus bridge apps](2011-07-27_facebook_app_for_ostatus) for more of the major
social networking sites.

Feedback and pull requests are welcome!
