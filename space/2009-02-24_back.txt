What happened? In short, my [hosting provider](http://pair.com/) disabled my
[PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/) CGI script, which runs this site.
It was using too much CPU on my server ([ambym](http://ambym.pair.com/)) for
sustained periods of time, due to a combination of [comment and referrer
spam](/space/referrer+spam) storms and
[inefficient](http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/registry/input/comments/comments.html)
[plugins](/space/pyblosxom+history), and it was impacting other sites.
I may not have liked that they turned me off, but it was only reasonable.

In the short term, I blocked a bunch of spammer IP addresses and optimized the
[comments](http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/registry/input/comments/comments.html)
and [history](/space/pyblosxom+history) plugins. In the long term, I'd love to
use either [FastCGI](http://fastcgi.com/) or [WSGI](http://wsgi.org/wsgi/) to avoid
the cost of starting up the python interpreter, loading all of the modules, and
initializing PyBlosxom on every single request. Unfortunately,
[pair](http://pair.com/) doesn't support them on
[shared accounts](http://www.pair.com/services/web_hosting/). Sigh.
