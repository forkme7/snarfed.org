Studio 767 Birthday Party

[Orkut](http://cs.stanford.edu/~orkut/) and
[Ken](https://profiles.google.com/kashcraft) threw a birthday party in Orkut's
new SF pad, Studio 767.

It was incredibly, fantastically over the top. Red carpet. Professional sound
and lights. An iPod turntable. Dancers. Fabulous people. A staff to guest ratio
comparable to a cruise. (Yes, you read that right.)

Most importantly, it rocked my socks...all the way...off. Happy birthday, guys!
