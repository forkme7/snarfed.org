Sylvia posted [pictures](http://tberekmarines.shutterfly.com/) from [Warrior
Day](http://www.usna.org/larson/larson.html) at
[Quantico](http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/), where her brother Thomas is in OCS
for the Marines. She and her mom got to fire weapons, ride in amphibious
vehicles and helicopters, try out basic training exercises, and generally get a
feel for life as a recruit.

Personally, I was sold after seeing pictures of her grinning madly and holding
[an assault
rifle](http://tberekmarines.shutterfly.com/action/slideshow?a=67b0de21b33ba88845e4&auto=0&idx=6&m=1&d=1147769364436)
and [a grenade
launcher](http://tberekmarines.shutterfly.com/action/slideshow?a=67b0de21b33ba88845e4&auto=0&idx=157&m=1&d=1147769549284).
Remind me to never, ever, ever mess with Sylvia again!
