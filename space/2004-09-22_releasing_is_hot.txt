Not to be outdone by [Maulik](Maulik), I've posted a couple new projects
I've wrapped up:
[autocutsel clipboard and primary patch](autocutsel_clipboard_and_primary_patch)
 and [nullprpl, a pidgin null protocol plugin](nullprpl_pidgin_null_protocol_plugin).
Neither is anywhere near as big as Maulik's
[Malbum](Malbum) program, though - which, by the way, is totally
[hot](http://hotornot.com/).
