Now, about that name... 

<div class="img" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px">
  <a href="/space/cdname.py"><img src="/space/cd.jpg" /></a>
</div>

I've released a new version of [cdname.py](/space/cdname.py), which reads
[CDDB](http://www.gracenote.com/gn_products/cddb.html)/[freedb](http://freedb.org/)
INF files and uses them to name MP3s. This release includes the ability to
generate M3U playlists, as well as a few small bug fixes. Drop, drop, drop it
while it's...I mean, [grab it while it's hot](/space/cdname.py)!
