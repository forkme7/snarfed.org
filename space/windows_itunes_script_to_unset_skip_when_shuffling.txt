[no\_skip\_when\_shuffling.js](/space/no_skip_when_shuffling.js) is a script for
[iTunes](http://apple.com/itunes/) for Windows that unsets the
[_skip when shuffling_](http://www.reelsmart.com/2006/01/28/itunes-tip-29-skip-tracks-when-shuffling/)
setting on all songs in a playlist. It was inspired by [an
AppleScript](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20070218041737189)
which does the same thing for iTunes on Mac OS X.

_Skip when shuffling_ prevents songs and podcasts from playing nice with the
iPod Shuffle. It won't play them when in shuffle mode, and more importantly,
[Autofill](http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/sync.html) won't see them at all.
Worse, iTunes sets _skip when shuffling_ by default on new podcasts when
they're downloaded. This script provides a workaround.

I have a [Smart Playlist](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=93139)
for the podcasts I haven't listened to yet. Every morning, I update my
podcasts, then run this script. When I plug in my iPod, Autofill syncs it so
that it has only the podcasts I haven't listened to yet.

You can [download the script](/space/no_skip_when_shuffling.js), or copy and
paste it from here:

    var playlist_name = "Podcasts";
    
    var iTunes = WScript.CreateObject("iTunes.Application");
    var sources = iTunes.Sources;
    var playlists = sources.ItemByName("Library").Playlists;
    var playlist = playlists.ItemByName(playlist_name);
    var tracks = playlist.Tracks;
    
    for (i = 1; i <= tracks.Count; i++) {
        tracks.Item(i).ExcludeFromShuffle = false;
    }

Set `playlist_name` to the name of the playlist you want it to change. Then,
make sure the file's extension in Windows is `.js`, and double-click on
it. It should be run by
[Windows Script
Host](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/wsh_overview.mspx)
([wscript.exe](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/wsh_runfromwindowsbasedhost.mspx?mfr=true)).
If it's not, change the File Type for `.js` files in Explorer's Folder
Options.

This script uses the [iTunes COM SDK for
Windows](http://developer.apple.com/sdk/itunescomsdk.html). That page has since
disappeared, so I used a
[Microsoft TechNet article on scripting
iTunes](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/funzone/tunes.mspx) -
Microsoft, weird, I know, but the article was invaluable. You can also still
find `iTunesCOMInterface.h` on [Google Code
Search](http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&q=+iTunesCOMInterface.h+show:tuaQ8-JRruc:VCewQzHOoTs:OeYmnRoCpzg&sa=N&cd=3&ct=rc&cs_p=svn://svn.berlios.de/mgoodies/trunk&cs_f=listeningto/players/iTunesCOMInterface.h#a0),
among others. Finally, [RipperDoc's
tutorial](http://blog.nogo.se/2007/01/17/scripting-itunes-making-an-alarm-clock/)
was helpful, as were
[Otto's](http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2005/10/20/itunes-javascripts/) and
[Doug's](http://dougscripts.com/itunes/itinfo/windowshelp.php) collections of
scripts.
