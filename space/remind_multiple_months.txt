Subject: multiple months?

hi all. i picked up remind a few days ago as a replacement for my clunky 
birthday reminder script and, i'm sad to say, cron jobs that reminded me 
to pay the rent and other bills. so far, i'm loving it!

given remind's sophisticated date handling, though, i was surprised to 
find that it doesn't support date specs with multiple months. for example, 
this line:

   7 Jan Apr June Sep MSG Prepay estimated income tax

gives this error:

   /home/ryanb/.reminders(22): Month specified twice

i searched the man page, readme, google, and the list archives, but 
couldn't find any way to specify multiple months. sure, i could split it 
up into four separate lines, but that's kind of hackish.

am i missing something obvious? if not, i'm inclined to write a patch to 
allow multiple months in date specs. david, would that be appropriate?

It's the only way.

fair enough. was that an intentional design decision? if not, i'd like to write 
a patch. would you mind? can you think of any reason i shouldn't?

Hi, Ryan.

Not really; it was just the way I did it.

It will be rather complex, because it will tie in to the guts of the
date computation algorithm.  But if you manage to do it and it looks good,
I'll incorporate it.

(I expect the complexity will be a bit more than you bargained for when
you look at the date calculation code. :-) )

Regards,

David.

Thanks to David for the "multiple day example" earlier on the list, i
pulled this on togather, it seems to work. Will it cover your needs?

FSET _M(M) monnum(trigdate()) == M
REM 7 SATISFY [_M(1) || _M(4) || _M(6) || _M(9)] MSG Prepay estimated income tax

Note that SATISFY is less efficient that specifying a month, but
for this example, it's probably OK.

It's a cool hack, though! :-)  Not sure how readable it is.

David.
