[Amano](http://www.amanochocolate.com/), one of the best chocolate makers in the
world, recently held a
["guess the origin" contest](http://www.seventypercent.com/2010/06/amano-new-origin-competition-win-a-years-supply-of-chocolate/)
to stir up buzz for a new bar they're introducing. I wasn't enough of a
cacao expert to guess, but I was still excited, since they're
[one of my favorite makers](http://snarfed.org/space/chocolate).

When they announced the answer, I wasn't just excited. I was shocked. Amano's
new chocolate is from the [Chuao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuao) region of
Venezuela, a prized cacao source widely thought to produce the best beans in the
world. It's so well known that some makers have even
[named themselves after it](http://www.chuaochocolatier.com/about.html).

For a long time, [Amedei](http://www.amedei.com/) has been the only way for fans
to get at Chuao's cacao, since they held an exclusive deal with the Chuao
village. Evidently Chuao is finally branching out, though. Good for them, and
good for us too! I can't wait to try Amano's take on these famous beans.

for their [hands on report](http://www.seventypercent.com/2010/06/amano-chuao/).
