switch control and caps lock

[Sun
keyboards](http://www.sunstuff.org/hardware/components/keyboards/) have a few
differences from normal 101-key keyboards. One is that the locations of the left
Control and Caps Lock keys are switched. If you use the Control key often, this
makes a big difference, ergonomically. Here's how to switch the left Control and
Caps Lock keys on normal keyboards, on any \*nix platform that runs X Windows.

Add these two lines to `~/.Xmodmap`:

    ! Switch caps lock and (left) control
    remove Lock = Caps\_Lock
    remove Control = Control\_L
    keysym Control\_L = Caps\_Lock
    keysym Caps\_Lock = Control\_L
    add Lock = Caps\_Lock
    add Control = Control\_L

Now load the changes into X:

    $ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap

Voila! You're now one step closer to Sun keyboard bliss.
