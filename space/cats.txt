cats

A collection of cat photos: Angel and Buffin, who live with my family, and
Gizmo, who lives with Matt and Kristin. They let me [cat-sit for
Gizmo](/space/2005-08-13_the_giz) recently while they were on their honeymoon.
Buttons and Snickers, who also live with my family, aren't here yet. I guess
they're camera shy.
