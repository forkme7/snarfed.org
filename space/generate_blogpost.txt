generate_blogpost.sh

I use [Stuart Rackham](http://srackham.wordpress.com/)'s
[blogpost.py](http://srackham.wordpress.com/blogpost-readme/)
to publish my pages and posts to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/).
It's great!

Unfortunately, when I [migrated to WordPress](2010-08-07_wordpress), I imported
lots of existing posts and pages that I also wanted to be able to update with
blogpost.py. So, I wrote a script to generate the `.blogpost` files for those
posts and pages: [generate_blogpost.sh](generate_blogpost.sh).

The script isn't too complicated. It just fetches all existing pages and posts
from MySQL, finds the corresponding `.txt` file, and generates a `.blogpost`
file for the post or page with the post id, type, title, and permalink stored in
the database.

To run it, simply pass the same parameters you'd pass to `mysql`, e.g.

    $ ./generate_blogpost.sh -h [HOST] -u [USER] [DATABASE]

Tested with blogpost.py version 0.9.3.
