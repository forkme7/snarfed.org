<br>From The Economist print edition</div></font><br><br><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1"><B>Mobile phones are increasingly useful as forensic evidence in trials</B></font><br>


<!--back--><p><font FACE="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">A PHONE says a lot about a person. In the trial of Ian Huntley it told the world rather more about him than he had anticipated. After murdering Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, Mr Huntley carefully removed any physical trace of their presence in his home. But he seemed unaware of the unerasable digital footprints that three mobile phones had left behind. These footprints were vital evidence in his conviction. </font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">As mobile phones proliferate they are becoming increasingly useful in British court cases and investigations. Some believe that evidence from them could become as important as <font size="-1">DNA </font>evidence and computer forensics.</font></p>
<cf_FloatingContent></cf_FloatingContent>
<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">The technique is based on the fact that mobile-phone companies keep information about the telephone numbers called, and where calls are made and received, for billing purposes. According to Peter Uglow, director of Focus Forensic Telecommunications in Bromsgrove, mobile-phone data helped disprove Mr Huntley's alibi. His girlfriend's phone was in Grimsby when she told the police she was with him. Mr Uglow's company provided an expert witness for the case, and a forensic technique called &#8220;cell site analysis&#8221;, a form of triangulation that estimates the location of a mobile phone when it is used. Mobile records also forced Mr Huntley to admit that he had changed the tyres on his car a day after dumping the children's bodies. </font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">Unless a phone is making calls, no record is kept of where it is, but in high priority cases the police can request live tracking of a phone's movements. This technique was used to monitor the phone of Jessica Chapman when she went missing. Police watched as the phone was switched off, and gave a &#8220;goodbye&#8221; signal to the network. Analysis showed that the only place this was likely to have happened was just outside or inside Mr Huntley's house. </font></p>

<p><font face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size="-1">A number of agencies, from the police, customs and excise, and the security services, to the Fire Authorities and Ambulance Services, are allowed to ask mobile-phone companies for this sort of data, known as traffic information. Libby Pritchard of Vodafone says it has a &#8220;steady stream&#8221; of requests for this kind of material. Electronic information, then, is becoming increasingly useful in identifying the guilty. Just how useful, though, is hard to tell: the Home Office keeps no records of how many of these requests are being made.</font></p>
