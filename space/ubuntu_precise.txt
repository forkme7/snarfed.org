I recently upgraded from
[Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com/)
[Lucid](https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/about-ubuntu/C/) (10.04) to
[Precise](https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-help/) (12.04). Similar to
my list of [tips for Lucid](ubuntu_lucid), [and Hardy](ubuntu_lucid), here are 
some tips for Ubuntu Precise. (I'm running it on a
[Thinkpad X201](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/landing_pages/thinkpad/2010/X201-X201s-X201tablet)).

  * I used to use `xmodmap` to swap the Caps Lock and left Control keys, but no
longer. It's evidently deprecated, and `setxkbmap` is now X.org's preferred way
to manipulate keymaps. This does the trick:

        setxkbmap -option ctrl:swapcaps

  * I used to use `aumix` as my volume control and mixer, but it
couldn't find the mixer device in Precise. I could have dug around for it, but
instead I just switched to `amixer`, which works fine.

    ...except that toggling mute with `amixer ... toggle` mutes ok but doesn't
unmute! A bit of investigation found that `toggle` mutes a bunch of channels,
including (for me) Master, Headphone, PCM, and Front, but only unmutes the
channel you tell it to toggle. Details in the
[bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/878986)
and these
[askubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/65764/how-do-i-toggle-sound-with-amixer)
[questions](http://askubuntu.com/questions/118675/mute-key-mutes-alsa-and-pulseaudio-but-unmutes-only-alsa).
The solution is to toggle all of the channels explicitly:

        echo 'sset Master toggle
         sset Headphone toggle
         sset PCM toggle
         sset Front toggle' | amixer --stdin -q


- no networkmanager
- xmodmap => setxkbmap for ctrl/caps lock


Enjoy Ubuntu Precise!
