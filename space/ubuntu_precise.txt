Ubuntu Precise

I recently upgraded from
[Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com/)
[Lucid](https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/about-ubuntu/C/) (10.04) to
[Precise](https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-help/) (12.04). Similar to
my list of [tips for Lucid](ubuntu_lucid), [and Hardy](ubuntu_lucid), here are 
some tips for Ubuntu Precise. (I'm running it on a
[Thinkpad X201](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/landing_pages/thinkpad/2010/X201-X201s-X201tablet)).

  * I used to use `xmodmap` to swap the Caps Lock and left Control keys, but no
longer. It's evidently deprecated, and `setxkbmap` is now X.org's preferred way
to manipulate keymaps. This does the trick:

        setxkbmap -option ctrl:swapcaps

  * I used to use `aumix` as my volume control and mixer, but it
couldn't find the mixer device in Precise. I could have dug around for it, but
instead I just switched to `amixer`, which works fine.

    ...except that toggling mute with `amixer ... toggle` mutes ok but doesn't
unmute! A bit of investigation found that `toggle` mutes a bunch of channels,
including (for me) Master, Headphone, PCM, and Front, but only unmutes the
channel you tell it to toggle. Details in the
[bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/878986)
and these
[askubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/65764/how-do-i-toggle-sound-with-amixer)
[questions](http://askubuntu.com/questions/118675/mute-key-mutes-alsa-and-pulseaudio-but-unmutes-only-alsa).
The solution is to toggle all of the channels explicitly:

        echo 'sset Master toggle
         sset Headphone toggle
         sset PCM toggle
         sset Front toggle' | amixer --stdin -q

  * On the topic of sound, it didn't initially work on my laptop because
    `/dev/snd/*` weren't world writable or readable. A quick
    `sudo chmod a+rw /dev/snd/*` fixed that, but it didn't stick across
    reboots, so I put it in my `.login`. Oddly, my workstation didn't have this
    permissions problem; it worked out of the box.

  * Lucid's [NetworkManager](http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/) package
    didn't come with a good command line utility, so I used
    [cnetworkmanager](http://vidner.net/martin/software/cnetworkmanager/).
    Precise's NetworkManager added
    `[nmcli](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/nmcli.1.html)` and
    `[nm-tool](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/nm-tool.1.html)`,
    both of which are great, especially `nmcli`. I use them instead of
    `[nm-applet](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/nm-applet.1.html)`.
    I also hacked the status bar in [notion](http://notion.sourceforge.net/) (n√©e
    [ion3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_(window_manager))), my window
    manager, to use them to find the current network connection:
    
        nmcli -terse -field devices,name,state con status \
          | sed -r "s/activated/\*/; s/activating/.../; s/deactivated/X/; s/:/ /g"

    and Wifi signal strength:
    
        nm-tool | grep \*`nmcli -t -f name con status` \
            | egrep -o "Strength [0-9]+" \
            | cut -d" " -f2-

  * It's not Precise-specific, but these AIM notifications from AOLSystemMsg
    have always annoyed me: _AOL System Msg: Your screen name (mrEman) is now
    signed into AOL(R) Instant Messenger (TM) in 2 locations._ I use Pidgin, so
    I finally looked around and found
    [this plugin](http://biodegradablegeek.com/2009/05/how-to-block-aims-annoying-aol-system-msg-in-pidgin/),
    which happily blocks them.

  * Here are some of the extra packages I installed:

    * apache2
    * apel
    * autocutsel
    * emacs-goodies-el
    * emacs23-el
    * emacs23-lucid
    * flashplugin-installer
    * flickcurl-utils
    * gcalcli
    * imagemagick
    * jnettop
    * lua-mode
    * lynx
    * mpg123
    * mysql-client
    * mysql-server
    * php-elisp
    * php5
    * php5-cgi
    * php5-cli
    * php5-curl
    * php5-mysql
    * pidgin
    * python-mysqldb
    * rxvt-unicode
    * sshfs
    * sysfsutils
    * tkcvs
    * tp-smapi-dkms
    * udev
    * usbmount
    * xloadimage
    * xkbset
    * xscreensaver
    * yaml-mode

    ...and I needed these to build [notion](http://notion.sourceforge.net/), my
    window manager:

    * gettext
    * liblua5.1-0-dev
    * libsm-dev
    * libx11-dev
    * libxext-dev
    * libxinerama-dev
    * libxrandr-dev


Enjoy Ubuntu Precise!
