To celebrate [my Dad](http://one-one.net/)'s birthday, my
family, [Walter](/gallery/Hong+Kong+2005/barefoot_ryan_walter.jpg), and I went
kayaking at [Elkhorn Slough](http://elkhornslough.org/) over the weekend.
We rented kayaks at [Kayak Connection](http://kayakconnection.com/). They had
good gear, and the people were chill and helpful.

The kayaking was fun, but the wildlife was the real draw. The otters,
shorebirds, seals, and other marine animals were very used to people, so they
let us get surprisingly close.

It was particularly cool to see the [otters using rocks to crack open crab
shells on their stomachs](http://elkhornslough.org/bestshot/060529bs.htm), as
well as the [pelicans dive bombing to come up with
fish](http://elkhornslough.org/critters/pelicans.htm). The seals, on the other
hand, just sat around and honked. I guess they didn't feel like performing for
us.

Happy Birthday, Dad!
