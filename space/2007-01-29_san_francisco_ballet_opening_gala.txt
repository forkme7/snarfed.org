_Update: [pictures](ballet_opening_gala) are up!_

If you're even the least bit
[WASP](http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Awasp)ish,
you've probably been on the traditional family Christmas trip to the
Nutcracker. You know what I'm talking about, right? There's at least one
crying kid and four bad Christmas sweaters per row, and the ballet troupe
hates it, but they grit their teeth because it subsidizes the rest of their
season?

Ah yes. I've been many times, and I've even managed to enjoy a couple of them.
Apart from that, though, I've never been to a _real_ ballet performance.
Symphony, yes. Opera, once or twice. Ballet, never. So when
[Nathan](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~nstoll/)
offered to take us to the
[San Francisco Ballet](http://sfballet.org/)'s
[Opening Night Gala](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/26/DDG8JNOVIF22.DTL&type=performance)
([more](http://sfciviccenter.blogspot.com/2007/01/san-francisco-ballets-opening-night.html),
[and](http://www.examiner.com/a-530253~They_could_have_danced_all_night.html)
[more](http://www.ballet.co.uk/dcforum/happening/6077.html)),
I jumped at the chance.

It was absolutely beautiful. Instead of a full-length program, it was a
collection of individual pieces, following a Spanish theme. There were
traditional pas de deux, edgy modern arrangements, and a few that were
inspired by other dance styles altogether. At times, they brought to mind the
tango, the flamenco, bull fighting, even and Civil War era gunfights.

One of the most striking was the world premiere of
[Bitter Tears](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?o=33&f=/c/a/2007/01/26/DDG8JNOVIF22.DTL&type=performance),
choreographed by Yuri Possokhov to music by Handel. It was a slow, impossibly
athletic tour de force for two dancers. It left the audience dazzled, more than
a little confused, and generated lots of buzz - both good and bad - at
intermission.

For most of the audience, though, the ballet itself wasn't even the main
event. The night started with a cocktail reception for the patrons, followed
by dinner, another reception after the performance, and a number parties. It was
a socialite tour de force.

Personally, I was happy just to be a fly on the wall. It was an amazing
evening. Thanks, Nathan!
