Games as teaching aids

A few weeks ago, my mom called to ask me about [games](/space/games). She
knows I play them and follow the industry, and she had a specific
question: where could she find screenshots of
[Modern Warfare 2](http://www.modernwarfare2.com/),
a popular recent game?

My curiosity got the better of me, and I had to ask. Why? 

My mom a teacher - a speech therapist, technically, but she spends most of her
time with developmentally delayed kids. Many of her students are low functioning
and have trouble with attention span, so she's always on the lookout for new
ways to keep them motivated and interested.

She'd heard and the boys in her class (and me) talk incessantly about video
games over the years, and she'd seen firsthand the spell they could cast over
even her lowest functioning kids. She realized she could harness that to help
motivate them while working on reasoning, comprehension, and language skills.

I pointed her to a few screenshots from the game, and a little background, and
she was off to the races. "Who is this guy?" she'd ask, pointing to a soldier in
one screenshot. "What's he doing? How about that guy? Why are they doing that?
Are they working together, or against each other? What happened before this?
What's going to happen next?"

Very cool. Such a great example of stepping outside yourself, thinking about
other people, and meeting them where they are.
