My [Brad Wolfe and the Moon CD](/space/Brad_Wolfe_and_the_Moon_CD) finally came
today! I'd ordered it ages ago, and whenever I played his
[demo](http://www.freedb.org/freedb_search_fmt.php?cat=folk&id=4605b206), I've
looked forward to getting all the other songs I'd only [heard him play in
person](/space/2004-07-04_brad_wolfe_and_stan_smith).

The CD itself is even better than I expected. It has startlingly high production
values, and despite all the shows I've been to, it included a couple songs I'd
never heard before. I can't wait for the [release
party](http://virtuous.com/events/v/181536628/2005-06-10.html)!
