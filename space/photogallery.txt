[photogallery](/space/photogallery.py) is a
[PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.sf.net/) plugin that displays a photo gallery,
with thumbnails. [Here's an example.](/gallery/Vegas+2006)

It's fairly basic. It just generates a single page with the thumbnails, linked
to their full-size pictures. There are config options for captions, number of
columns, and the URL trigger. You can also optionally provide header and footer
text for each gallery.

However, it doesn't generate pages for each picture, it doesn't provide
navigation, and it doesn't generate the thumbnails automatically.
