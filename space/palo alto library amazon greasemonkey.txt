The [Palo Alto Library Greasemonkey
script](http://ryan.barrett.name/paloaltolibrary.user.js) adds a link to Amazon
that shows whether the book you're looking at is available in the [Palo Alto
Libraries](http://cityofpaloalto.org/library/).

There are plugins with similar functionality for other libraries and catalogs;
[see below](/space/palo+alto+library+amazon+greasemonkey#others) for a list. The
Palo Alto Library script differs mainly in its usability. Instead of simply
linking to the library's search page, it displays the book's availability
directly inside Amazon. More importantly, it's color-coded, since [users don't
read](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000062.html) (and
[shouldn't have to](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html)!). Green means
it's there, yellow means it's temporarily unavailable (checked out, on order,
etc.), red means it's not in the
library.![/space/available_thumb.jpg](/space/available_thumb.jpg)

[on order](/space/on_order.jpg), [in

Eric Galloway for adding "on order" support.

Background: [Jon Udell](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/)'s [Library
Lookup](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html)
is a great example of Firefox's potential for simple, yet powerful client-side
tools. Library Lookup lets you build a bookmarklet that, when you're browsing
[Amazon](http://amazon.com/), automatically searches your library for the book
you're currently viewing. Very cool.

When [GreaseMonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/) started picking up steam,
Jon wrote a [script](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/04/04.html#a1207)
based on Library Lookup that searched his library for the currently displayed
book. Even better, it _parsed the results_ and inserted a link into the Amazon
page that said whether it was available or checked out. Palo Alto Library was
inspired by, and is based on, that
script.
