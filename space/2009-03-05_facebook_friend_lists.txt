Facebook Friend Lists

[Facebook](http://facebook.com/)'s
[Friend List](http://www.facebook.com/help.php?hq=friend+list&ref=hq)
feature is invaluable. It lets you create lists for different groups of friends,
like work, family, local, or just people you want to pay more (or less)
attention to.

It's easy to add or remove individual people from a friend list, but at first
glance, it seems difficult and tedious to make larger changes to friend lists.
That's where the subtle, almost hidden,
[Select Multiple Friends](http://www.facebook.com/help.php?hq=%22select+multiple+friends%22&ref=hq)
link comes in. (It's next to the "Add to List" text box where you can type in a
person's name to add to the friend list.)

It pops up a window that shows your friends visually, three across, and lets you
click on them to add or remove them.

The same interface is evidently used for inviting people to events, groups, etc.
It's also exposed to Facebook Apps as

</div>

I particularly like that the
[RSS feeds](http://www.facebook.com/help.php?hq=rss+friends&ref=hq)
for friends' status updates, posted items, etc. also support friend lists. I
used to subscribe to the RSS feed for all of my friends' status updates, but it
was _way_ too noisy. I now subscribe to a much smaller friend list.

It's not all sunshine and kittens, though. The
[News Feed Preferences](http://www.facebook.com/feed_prefs.php) page, which
[lets you control](http://www.facebook.com/help.php?hq=news+feed+preferences&ref=hq)
which people and kinds of stories are shown on your home page and news feed, is
missing out. Its _More About These Friends_ and _Less About These Friends_ lists
are in desperate need of friend list love!

Otherwise, friend lists are great, particularly the RSS feed support. With
that, I rarely have to actually use Facebook at all!
