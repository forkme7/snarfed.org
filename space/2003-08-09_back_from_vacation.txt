Back from vacation

Ahhh..... I've been at a family reunion in Florida for the past week and a half,
hanging out with cousins and drinking daiquiris and doing nothing. That's right,
nothing. I sat back, relaxed, and got a whole lot of nothing done. I caught up
with my backlog, and now I have a complete roadmap of the next few months. I've
got a lot of nothing to do!

Sometimes it's tough to find the right balance between doing nothing and
sleeping...not to mention setting aside a little spare time for work, food,
social commitments, etc. But I'm sure I'll get it right eventually. I go back to
work on Monday, but I have the whole weekend to get into the swing of doing
nothing on a regular basis. Wish me luck!

P.S. If you can't tell already, I'm not the blogging type. You'll get updates
every week or two if I'm lucky. If you want fresh content, log on and write
stuff yourself, or post pictures or video or whatever. See you around...
