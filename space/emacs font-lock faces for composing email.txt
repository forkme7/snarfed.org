emacs font-lock faces for composing email

I
use [Pine](http://www.washington.edu/pine/) (no, [not GMail](/space/gmail vs
pine)) as my email client. I set its [alternate
editor](http://www.washington.edu/pine/tech-notes/config-notes.html#alt-ed) to
[Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/) so I can use it to write email.

Among other Emacs features,
[font-locking](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/Font-Lock.html#Font-Lock),
ie colored highlighting, has spoiled me. Color in general is a [huge usability
win](http://www.colormatters.com/usability.html). It's such a difference that
when I _don't_ have font-lock, editing a whole page of flat, white text makes me
feel slightly dumb.

Sadly, I didn't have font-lock for composing emails. So, I poked around and
found
[u-vm-color.el](http://de.geocities.com/ulf_jasper/lisp/u-vm-color.el.txt). It
was written for [VM](http://www.wonderworks.com/vm/), an Emacs MUA, so it's a
little heavyweight. Still, it can color quoted text, signatures, and other text
just like Pine's message viewer.

To set it up, [download
u-vm-color.el](http://de.geocities.com/ulf_jasper/lisp/u-vm-color.el.txt), put
it somewhere in your load-path (e.g. /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/), and add this
to your ~/.emacs:


    (require 'u-vm-color)


    ; ugly heuristic to font-lock pine emails automatically

    (add-hook 'find-file-hooks

      (lambda ()

        (if (equal "pico." (substring (buffer-name (current-buffer)) 0 5))

            (u-vm-color-fontify-buffer))))


    ; these match pine's defaults. see M-x list-colors-display for other options

    (set-face-foreground 'u-vm-color-citation-1-face "cyan")

    (set-face-foreground 'u-vm-color-citation-2-face "lime green")

    (set-face-foreground 'u-vm-color-citation-3-face "blue")

    (set-face-foreground 'u-vm-color-citation-4-face "dark slate gray")

    (set-face-foreground 'u-vm-color-citation-5-face "dark slate blue")

    (set-face-foreground 'u-vm-color-signature-face  "gray30")

Happy font-locked emailing!
