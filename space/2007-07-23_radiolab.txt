Recently, I've been listening to [Radio Lab](http://radiolab.org/), an
[NPR](http://npr.org/) show produced by [WNYC](http://wnyc.org/). It's really
good. It tackles universal themes like
[morality](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2006/04/28),
[consciousness](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/season1_2005.html),
[sleep](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2007/05/25), and
[stress](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/02112005), combining
human perspectives with plain-english explanations of brain chemistry and
neuroscience.

Not only is the subject matter cool, the editing is much more dynamic than the
average NPR show. It starts with an informal discussion between the producers,
and stirs in quotes, ambient sounds, and interview snippets to create an oddly
fluid mix.

I've been downloading past shows from
[iTunes](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=152249110)
and [radiolab.org](http://radiolab.org/). So far, I'm loving them.
