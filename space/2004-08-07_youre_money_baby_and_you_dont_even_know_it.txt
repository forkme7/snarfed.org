_Update: [pictures are up!](Johns_Bachelor_Party)_

Last weekend, I headed out to fabulous Las Vegas for
[John](/space/john_muscle_shirt_rarr)'s
bachelor party. (If you know John, I probably don't need to say any more.) It
was a blast. We had around ten guys, and between us, we tore up the strip. It
was everything a bachelor party should be, and nothing else. :P

A few of the guys arrived on Thursday, including the groom, and the first order
of business was a makeover for John, which included a haircut (with
highlights!), a facial, and most importantly, a shave. By the time it was over,
he was GQ and then some.

The makeover set him up for the next challenge of the weekend, a scavenger hunt.
We had a huge list of things he had to do before we left - take a shot of
whiskey with a girl in a cowboy hat, give a horseback ride to a midget, pound a
beer with a straw, etc. Guys, if you're getting married, take note: this is a
_great_ idea, not to mention a great excuse to embarrass the groom 50 different
ways.

The rest of the trip was pretty much a blur of food, gambling, bars, clubs, and,
uh, fine art. Well, at least the first four. I was massively sleep deprived by
the end of the weekend, but it was worth it. Now, for the rehearsal dinner.
