Should I finish <i>Gravityâ€™s Rainbow</i>?

It seems like only yesterday I was
[debating whether to finish _1Q84_](2012-07-02_1q84), and here I am again,
wondering the same thing about
[Thomas Pynchon's _Gravity's Rainbow_](http://books.google.com/books?id=iPDGp7VT8H8C).

It's a 760 page monster, and to call it opaque is an understatement. It's
gloriously, unabashedly weird and surreal, an acid trip stream of consciousness
that's often entertaining and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. It reminds me a
bit of
[David Foster Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace)'s
_[Infinite Jest](http://books.google.com/books?id=Nhe2yvx6hP8C)_, which I loved.

Unfortunately, _[Rainbow](http://books.google.com/books?id=iPDGp7VT8H8C)_ is
unapologetically hard to follow. It skips from setting to setting, narrator to
narrator like a Ritalin-soaked teenager with a TV remote, only occasionally
deigning to inform me where it's landed. I keep up barely half of the time, and
it leaves me exhausted.

It's widely regarded as
[one of the great works of American literature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity%27s_Rainbow#Cultural_Influence),
so I'm reluctant to give up without a fight.
[Fans offer encouraging advice](http://www.amazon.com/Gravitys-Rainbow-Classic-20th-Century-Penguin/dp/product-description/0140188592/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&n=283155&s=books)
to struggling readers like me: it's ok if you don't get everything, focus on the
stuff you do get, and don't give up too early.

Still, I'm struggling something fierce. I'm over 150 pages in, but that's just a
fifth of the way. Have you read it? Should I keep going? Any words of wisdom?
