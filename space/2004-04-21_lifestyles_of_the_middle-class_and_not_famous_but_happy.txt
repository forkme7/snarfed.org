Lifestyles of the Middle-Class and Not Famous...But Happy

2004](/space/Shoni%27s_Wedding_2004)

I just got back from a too-short vacation in Abilene, three hours west of
Dallas, in the heart of West Texas. Abilene is Susan's home town, and she was
invited to be a bridesmaid in her friend Shoni's wedding, so I went as her date.

Actually, since she was a bridesmaid, Susan didn't really need me at all...but I
was really looking forward to seeing her, and she and Shoni said ok, as long as
you promise to stay out of the way, and don't eat too much at the reception, and
don't you dare show up at the bachelorette party, just run along and play on the
wireless connection at the hotel, since you do something or other with computers
anyway, right?

So I went. Abilene may not exactly be a tourist destination, but we didn't care.
We visited Susan's her old house, her church, her elementary school, and other
places she grew up with. I met her childhood friends, who were also bridesmaids,
and their families welcomed us with open arms. And of course, the wedding was a
blast. All in all, it was a nostalgic, fun, and overwhelmingly happy trip.
