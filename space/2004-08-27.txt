### Sure, but could you do _another_ 50?

Last weekend, I roadtripped down to southern cali with my family for my
grandparents, [Ray](http://www.smalltownusa.net/stauthorsbios.html#anchorRL) and
[Nancy](http://www.smalltownusa.net/staboutus.html)'s 50th wedding anniversary.
It was a great trip, and an incredible party. They had it in their back yard, so
it wasn't big, but it was very classy. Gold trim, linen tablecloths, nice silver
and china, and lots of my grandparents' friends socializing and having fun.

One of my parents' gifts to them was a scrapbook full of letters from old
friends, relatives, and even celebrities, wishing my grandparents a happy 50th.
My parents had sent out letters asking for greetings a few months before, and
they got a ton of replies! It was a great idea, and it brought tears to my
grandmother's eyes when she read them.

My parents are on vacation right now, so no pictures yet...but I'll post them
when they get back.
