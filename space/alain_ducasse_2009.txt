Alain Ducasse

While I was on [vacation](2009-10-27-back_from_vacation) in
[Paris](2009-10-28-paris), I managed to get a reservation at
[Alain Ducasse](http://www.plaza-athenee-paris.com/alain-ducasse-plaza-athenee).
It was a great experience, mostly due to the food.

The pictures are from
[Jane's album](http://picasaweb.google.com/JaneLu05/ParisOct2009).
Also see my [food highlights post](2009-10-30-food_highlights) and the
[L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon album](atelier_de_joel_robuchon_2009).
