Have you read Haruki Murakami's new epic novel
[1Q84](http://books.google.com/books?id=SSk8YgEACAAJ)? I'm a bit beyond the
halfway point, comfortably past the big scene in the hotel room, and I enjoyed
the first "book," but the last few hundred pages have been a bit flat. I'm
debating whether to keep going.

If you've read it, did it get better? Should I finish it?

I've noticed the same lazy, sedated quality in all of Murakami's writing, to one
degree or another. It was overpowering in the short stories in
[The Elephant Vanishes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elephant_Vanishes), and
much less pronounced in novels like
[Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard-Boiled_Wonderland_and_the_End_of_the_World),
but it definitely seems like a consistent style.
