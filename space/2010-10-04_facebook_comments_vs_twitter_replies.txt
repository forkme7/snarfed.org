Facebook comments vs. Twitter replies

[A](http://cl8on.blog.com/) [few](http://originalcynk.com/)
[friends](http://www.thefacebookera.com/) and I have an ongoing discussion about
the cultural differences between [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) and
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/). We recently focused on one key difference:
replying to posts. Specifically, Facebook
[comments](http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=12428) are fundamentally different
from [status updates](http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=12872), but Twitter
[@ replies](http://support.twitter.com/articles/221188) are still
normal [tweets](http://support.twitter.com/articles/219954). That makes me sad.

I don't use Facebook much, or Twitter at all, apart from
[syndicating this blog](http://twitter.com/snarfed_org), but I do read many
[friends' tweets](https://twitter.com/#!/snarfed_org/following) and
[Facebook posts](2009-03-05_facebook_friend_lists) via
[RSS](http://support.twitter.com/articles/15361-how-to-find-your-rss-feed), and
I occasionally want to reply to something. On Facebook, I do that by commenting,
like I would on a blog, but I never reply on Twitter.

I saw a friend's tweet the other day and wanted to respond, and I actually
entertained the idea of signing up and replying for real. My immediate "hell no"
reaction was so visceral and strong that it surprised me, so I took a minute to
figure out why i felt so strongly.

As I mentioned, Facebook distinguishes between status updates and comments
strongly and explicitly. Twitter, on the other hand, treats doesn't. they're all posts. you can kind of mark a
post as a comment with @, but it's still a first-class post that shows up in
your own tweet stream and gets published to your followers.

i know that was a conscious, intentional decision on twitter's part,
and it may have been the right one overall, but it doesn't work for
me. i guess i have a much higher bar for things i want to post myself,
ie publish as a first-class post coming from me, vs replies to
friends' posts. that's probably why i never post fb status updates and
pretty much only do blog posts, since i can be anal and perfectionist
about the long form prose, pictures, links, etc.

it makes me sad. at this point i probably read just as many updates
from friends on twitter as on fb, if not more, and i'd love to reply
to some of them but twitter's product decision doesn't work with my
own personality and style. meh.



Two things:
1. @'s in your stream only show in other's cumulative stream view if
they follow the same person. so in my signed in twitter view, when
everyone's updates are musher together like a chronological news feed,
I'd only see @heaven replies by my friends, not random ones from
people I don't follow. so there is more thread context, and they are
2nd class updates. if I wanted everyone to see it like a regular
update, I'd put a "." at the beginning, or put the name deeper into
the update.

2. the new twitter shows recent @'s around a tweet so you can follow
the thread within the same pane.

in other words, I do think @'s are treated with as much context around
the instigant as on facebook (for a logged in user's view on www or a
client), even with timeline reigning supreme.



ooh, interesting! thanks. most of that is obviously news to me, since
i don't follow twitter developments, and very welcome.

i should have been clearer about one thing: what i really want here
isn't "positive" context, ie seeing additional information like the
original tweet that's being replied to, the full thread/timeline.
instead, i want "negative" context. i don't want my replies or
comments appearing to my followers, or even random people looking at
my tweet stream, at all. i really want them to be *only* comments, ie
they'd show up under the original person's tweet, or thread, but *not*
as first-class posts/tweets from me.

your #1 definitely helps with that, but for me at least, it's not
quite enough. it sounds like people will still see my @ replies if
they look at my tweet stream directly, or if they see tweets via other
means like rss, etc.

out of curiosity, do you agree with the fundamental product difference
that in twitter, everything really is a first class post at heart,
while in fb, etc., there's a fundamental difference between posts and
comments/replies? it definitely feels that way to me as a very naive
user, but maybe i'm just not clueful enough.
