GDC 2006 notes

[![gdc2006.jpg](/space/gdc2006.jpg)](/space/GDC_2006)

This was my fifth year at [GDC](http://gdconf.com/), and as always, it's a lot
of fun to take a break for a bit and immerse myself in an entirely different
world. It's also a little overwhelming, so I had to take a few days to let the
sleep deprivation and brain overload wear off before I could [type up my
notes](/space/GDC_2006).
