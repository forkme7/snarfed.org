linux time zones
[![/space/clock.jpg](/space/clock.jpg)](/space/linux+time+zones)

I recently had to change the
time zone on a linux server, and while linux _handles_ time zones and locales
well, _changing_ the system's time zone isn't well documented.

I searched for a single command that would do it, probably run as root, but no
luck. zdump(8), zic(8), and tzfile(5) have lots of good information, but none of
them actually changes the time zone.

After some googling, I determined that /etc/localtime determines the system's
time zone. It's usually a copy of or symlink to a file in /usr/share/zoneinfo. I
ended up symlinking it to PST8PDT, for Pacific Time. If you're in another time
zone, the file names should be self-explanatory. (There's [more
information](http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/1996/04/msg00527.html) on the
debian-user mailing list.)

Of course, I'm sure this isn't the officially endorsed method. If anyone knows
what that is, please [let me know](http://ryan.barrett.name/contact.html)!
