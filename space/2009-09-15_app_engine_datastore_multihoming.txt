I recently
[posted about datastore multihoming](http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2009/09/migration-to-better-datastore.html),
which I've been working on for a while now, on the
[App Engine blog](http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/).
The post is similar to the
[Transactions Across Datacenters talk](http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/TransactionsAcrossDatacenters.html)
I gave at [Google I/O](http://code.google.com/events/io/) earlier this year, 
but it has much more detail on how we're applying those lessons to the
datastore itself.

When I was [at PDC last year](/space/windows+azure+impressions)
for Microsoft's [Windows Azure](http://azure.com/) announcement,
one of my strongest impressions was how much "under the hood" information
there was. A number of talks went deep into Azure's internal design decisions and
implementation. As I
[described at the time](/space/windows+azure+impressions#information):

> The internal details on how Azure works were particularly compelling.
> Developers may not need that information to write Azure services, but providing
> it drastically increases their confidence and comfort level in the system.
> 
> Other developers at PDC mentioned this, and I also felt it personally, at a gut
> level, long before I identified what it was. My reactions to "how to" talks
> varied widely, but every time I went to an "under the covers" talk, Azure felt
> more and more solid.

In the same vein, I'm proud that we've made
[such](http://code.google.com/events/io/sessions/FromSparkPlugToDriveTrain.html)
[a](http://sites.google.com/site/io/under-the-covers-of-the-google-app-engine-datastore)
[concerted](http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/index_building.html)
[effort](http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/msg/ba95ded980c8c179?pli=1)
to be transparent about App Engine's inner workings. This datastore multihoming
blog post is definitely part of that trend.

Happily, reception seems to be positive so far. Fingers crossed!
