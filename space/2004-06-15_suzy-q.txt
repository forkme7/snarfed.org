[Susan's](http://groups.msn.com/suzcambridge/shoebox.msnw) coming to visit!!!
She'll be here from Wednesday 6/16 to Tuesday 6/22. If you want to hang out with
her while she's here, [let me know](/space/about). I've
tried to connect up with people, but you all know how bad my memory is, much
less my ability to plan any farther than about a day in advance. :P

Oh, and if you missed it the first time, I may have a girlfriend, but I'm still
a [big fat geek](/ryan.barrett.name/), just counting the seconds until she
gets here.
