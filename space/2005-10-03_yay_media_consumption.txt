I saw [Serenity](http://serenitymovie.com/) over the weekend, and it was a lot
of fun. Definitely a worthwhile way to spend a couple hours, especially since I
loved the TV show, [Firefly](http://fireflywiki.org/). It gave us fans a good
fix, and it tied up one of the main plot lines nicely. I doubt I would have
liked Serenity as much if I hadn't seen Firefly, though.

To recap, if you haven't seen Firefly, watch it, then go see Serenity. If you've
seen Firefly, you don't need me to tell you to see Serenity. If you're a
[Browncoat](http://browncoats.serenitymovie.com/serenity/), you're probably
already halfway done writing me an email to complain that I didn't fawn over the
movie enough in this post. :P

As for other media, I'm passing the time until [The
Wire](http://hbo.com/thewire/)'s fourth season with
[Lost](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/), which opened with a bang. What's up
with Walt already? Which button was he talking about? What's the "D'harma"
organization that has its logo stamped on Desmond's food and the shark's tail?
Why are those damn numbers _everywhere_?

Somehow, I doubt _any_ of those questions will be answered on Wednesday...but
yes, I'll watch anyway.
