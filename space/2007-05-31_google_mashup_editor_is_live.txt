Stick a fork in us,
[we're done](http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/developerday_20070530.html)!

OK, scratch that, we're nowhere near done. Still, we're very excited that
[Mashup Editor](http://googlemashups.com/) has launched. It's one of the first
Google products based on my team's project, a piece of infrastructure that we
hope will power many Google products in the future.

Here's a screenshot.
Feel free to [take a quick tour](http://code.google.com/gme/tour/tour1.html),
