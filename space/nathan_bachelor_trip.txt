Nathan`s Bachelor Trip

For Nathan's bachelor party, we went to Napa, camped, tasted wine, rode in
classic cars, ate at [Bistro Jeanty](http://www.bistrojeanty.com/),
[sabered a champagne bottle](2006-10-11_how_napoleon_opened_champagne), "burned
the burro," roasted Nathan (poorly), listened to him roast himself (better),
melted glass, downfell, and fell down.
