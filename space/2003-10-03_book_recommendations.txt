Book Recommendations

Due to popular request, I've posted a list of some of the [books I've read
recently](books) that I've liked. If you're a regular here and you'd like
to add recommendations, please do! Just [log in](/exec/login.jsp) (or
[register](/exec/register.jsp)), go to the [books](books) page, and click
on the edit link.
