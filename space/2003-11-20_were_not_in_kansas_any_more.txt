We're not in Kansas any more...

So, we ([Google](http://google.com/)) recently announced that we're
[moving](http://www.sgi.com/newsroom/press_releases/2003/july/google.html) to
the [old SGI campus](sgi_campus.jpg), just across the street from our
current campus. Most of the engineers are moving in the next couple of days,
which has generated a lot of interest in the new campus...

..but who would have guessed that the most controversial feature would be the
bathrooms! Specifically, the [Toto Washlet](http://www.washlet.com/)
toilets:

They have a kind of remote-control, robotic bidet thing built into them.
Seriously. I'm not kidding:

The best part is the [promotional
video](http://www.washlet.com/movies/Washlet1.mov) they have up on their site.
It's absolutely hilarious...it would fit right in on Saturday Night Live, except
it's real. I guess truth really is stranger than fiction.
