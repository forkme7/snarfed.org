_Updated 2007-02-23._

[hardcodedates](hardcodedates.py) is a
[PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.sf.net/) plugin that overrides Pyblosxom's
[default mtime handling](http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/1.3.1/manual/x704.html)
to read mtimes from a file, instead of from the filesystem.

This has a number of benefits. Similar to
[other](http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/registry/date/metadate)
[plugins](http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/registry/date/rememberdates),
it allows you to manually specify each entry's mtime. The mtimes are stored in
a single file, so PyBlosxom doesn't need to stat every entry. Finally, it adds
mtimes for new entries, to preserve their original mtime and to avoid stat
calls.
