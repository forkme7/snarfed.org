The science of love

I just read a [really cool
article](http://economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=2424049&CFID=21870897&CFTOKEN=1979220-b952540c-ebb2-4f17-9101-8eee779bdd0a)
in the latest Economist. Scientists have made progress understanding the
science, genetics, and neurochemistry of love. Yeah, you read that right.
_Love._

My favorite quote:

> Parts of the brain that are love-bitten include the one
> responsible for gut feelings, and the ones which generate
> the euphoria induced by drugs such as cocaine. So the
> brains of people deeply in love do not look like those of
> people experiencing strong emotions, but instead like
> those of people snorting coke.

It's very worth reading. Also, this book is listed as a reference, which might
be cool:
