I've been working on adding [OpenID](http://openid.net/) support inside Google as a
[20% project](http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/static.py?page=about.html&about=eng)
for a while now. It took some evangelizing, but our first
OpenID project, commenting in
[Blogger](http://blogger.com/), has
[finally launched](http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/2007/11/new-feature-openid-commenting.html)!

For the OpenID geeks out there, we've turned Blogger into a consumer, aka
relying party. It has full support for
[1.0](http://openid.net/specs/specs-1.0.bml) and
[1.1](http://openid.net/specs/specs-1.0.bml), and
partial support for
[2.0 draft 12](http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0-12.html).
(It's missing XRI-based discovery.)

OpenID commenting is currently supported in [Blogger
Draft](http://draft.blogger.com/), ie beta, but we'll roll it out to all
users soon. Keep an eye out for future OpenID projects...
