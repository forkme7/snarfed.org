My freshman college roommate and I bonded over music, among other things.
[Tool](http://toolshed.down.net/), in particular, and later
[A Perfect Circle](www.aperfectcircle.com/). To be
fair, you could skip to the chase and say we bonded over
[Maynard James Keenan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynard_James_Keenan).

We appreciated both bands deeply, but quickly noticed that we appreciated
fundamentally different things. He was inspired by Maynard's lyrics; they're
poetic, disturbing, and wryly amusing all at once. I marvelled at the
drummer's unsettling, byantine rhythyms, and at the bassist's delicate balance
between harmony and noise. A Perfect Circle was very different, but we bonded
over its constituent parts in a similar way.

As a long time classical pianist, I can happily, if needlessly, reassure you.
The non-lyrical part of music still has substance. On the contrary, I think
most instrumental music has far more substance than the _music_ part of
lyrical music. (Gershwin, and jazz in general, may be an exception. Maybe
opera, too, but I avoid that like the plague, so I wouldn't know.)

Music also has at least a few different orthogonal dimensions, just like
lyrics. You pay attention to the meaning of the words in lyrics, but also
their rhythym and aesthetics, right? Same with music. I love lots of pieces
for themselves - Debussy's _La Mer_, Barber's _Agnus Dei_, [Imogen Heap's
_Hide and Seek_](http://imogenheap.co.uk/player/) - but I also love listening
to the arrangement, the interpretation, the performance.

OK, bringing it back to lyrics. You've heard the so-called
[Phish remix](http://www.phish.net/faq/ginandjuice.html) of
[Dr. Dre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre)'s
_Gin and Juice_, right? Or
[Jonathan Coulton](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/)'s
[cover](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songdetails/Baby%20Got%20Back) of [Sir
Mix-a-Lot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Mix-a-Lot)'s _Baby Got Back_?
Same words as the originals, but man, vive le difference, huh? That's some
quality orthogonal dimensions right there.

Anyway. You knew all that. You were asking, what do you _do_ when you
listen to music without words? Personally, I do the same thing that you
probably do when you listen to music _with_ words. Absorb it. Turn it
over in your head. Compare it to other pieces by the same composer. Compare it
to other pieces, other composers. Listen for individual layers, voices,
instruments. Try to trace the music back to events in the composer's life, or
the performance to the orchestra's.

At least, that's the idea. I'm usually lucky if I get past the "turn it over
in my head" stage. Still, I just heard
[Mozart and Sibelius](http://www.sfsymphony.org/templates/event_info.asp?nodeid=250&callid=93&eventid=1077)
at the symphony, so you can probably chalk all this up to nostalgia, because I
love Sibelius, especially live, and because it's past the halfway point of the
season.

...and because I miss the piano. [I have low-grade RSI](/space/2006-11-18),
and playing piano is even worse on hands than typing. My RSI isn't bad, but
still, I'm working hard to keep it that way, so I can't really play. I have to
go with the whole bread-winning thing.

Instead, I listen to music I used to play. I listen to music I hoped to play
one day. I go to the symphony. And I sit here and log a few thousand
unnecessary keystrokes on my hands' odometers. Perverse, huh?
