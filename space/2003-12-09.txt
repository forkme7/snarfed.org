### Average Joe winner not so

I hate to say this, but I was all prepped and ready to watch the Average Joe
finale last night, to see if a beauty queen would pick someone based on their
looks or money. Jason is hot (let's face it, he is) and lives with his parents,
working through school (admirable), but not necessarily the brightest kid on the
block. Adam is not hot, but neither is he unattractive, is charming, has made a
modest couple mil ($$$), was on the cover of Fortune mag, is tall, owns his own
bar, and absolutely adored Milena. Guess who she chose? The hot guy. Dumbass
skanky ho. But then I thought - what would I do? More on this later.
