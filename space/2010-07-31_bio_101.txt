I've been taking an
[online biology class](http://webcast.berkeley.edu/course_details_new.php?seriesid=2010-B-7703&semesterid=2010-B)
over the last few weeks. Well, "taking" might be a strong word. I'm not reading
a textbook or doing problem sets or labs, I'm just listening
to the lectures. Still, I'm really enjoying it, and
with any luck, I might even learn a thing or two.

I never paid much attention to bio in school. I took the "dumb" (not AP) class
in high school, and nothing in college. Since then, though, I've thought a fair
amount about health, which eventually inspired some interest in medicine and
human biology. I also have [friends](http://maulik.net/) who follow and work(ed)
in biotech, and that field is only getting more interesting as time passes.

Fundamentals are key, though, so I'm starting at the bottom. I remember some of
the basics from high school. Cell membrane, nucleus, mitochondria, golgi body.
Lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, oh my. Most of it is new to me, though, and
really interesting. Channel proteins, extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton,
microtubules. The systems nature evolved for us can be amazingly clever and
sophisticated.

I also have to give credit to [Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu/),
[OpenCourseWare](http://www.ocwconsortium.org/), and the progressive attitude
across higher education. Their curriculum and professors are some of their most
valuable assets, and yet they give them away freely to random people like me.
Go college!
