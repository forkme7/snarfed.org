Don't ask me why, but I've been itching to go to the zoo for the past month or
so. It's been at least a decade since I last went to a zoo, and with all the
[Planet Earth](http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/planetearth/) and
[Wild Chronicles](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/podcasts/wildchronicles.html)
I've been watching, I had the urge.

I finally found a free day on Sunday, so I dragged my family to the
[Oakland Zoo](http://oaklandzoo.com/). It's not quite as well known as the
[San Francisco Zoo](http://www.sfzoo.org/), but it also hasn't been quite as
[dramatic](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/27/MNABU4Q5T.DTL&hw=zoo+tiger&sn=003&sc=487) recently.
I'd also met to a number of people recently who had good things to say about
it, including one of the zoo's handlers.

So, we tried it. It definitely wasn't big, but I didn't mind. It felt more low
key and manageable, and the animals felt closer and more intimate than they
might have in a larger place. What's more, they all seemed comfortable,
healthy, and very at home in their habitats. I didn't get the "miserable caged
animal" feeling at any of the exhibits, which was a pleasant surprise.

The animals themselves were both entertaining and inspiring. The
[lions](http://www.oaklandzoo.org/meet_the_animals/african-lion),
[elephants](http://www.oaklandzoo.org/meet_the_animals/african-elephant), and
[giraffes](http://www.oaklandzoo.org/meet_the_animals/giraffe,-reticulated)
were all worth seeing, of course, but some of the lesser animals were even
more compelling. In particular, the densely populated
[bat colony](http://www.oaklandzoo.org/meet_the_animals/malayan-flying-fox) was
absolutely fascinating. I had no idea bats were so expressive! The
[parrots](http://www.oaklandzoo.org/meet_the_animals/yellow-naped-amazon-parrot*),
[chimpanzees](http://www.oaklandzoo.org/meet_the_animals/chimpanzee), and
[frogs](http://www.oaklandzoo.org/meet_the_animals/golden-mantella-frog) also drew me in
for much longer than I expected.

The one animal I was disappointed to miss was the
[Malayan Sun Bear](http://www.oaklandzoo.org/meet_the_animals/sun-bear). It's
much smaller than its northern cousins, only 60-100lbs, but much more agile.
I'll have to find it next time I visit!
