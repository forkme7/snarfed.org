Small Town USA

If you grew
up in a small town, if you've driven through small towns and wondered about
them, if you've ever started a sentence with "I remember when"...welcome to
[Small Town USA](http://smalltownusa.net/).

Somehow small towns evoke a special tranquility that lends itself to story
telling and sharing. Everybody knows somebody from a small town - it might even
be you.

Go reading down Memory Lane in our new book [Growing Up On Memory
Lane](http://smalltownusa.net/stgrowingup.html)!

If you remember simpler times and long summer nights on the porch swing, you
should read this book. [Growing Up On Memory
Lane](http://smalltownusa.net/stgrowingup.html) is a touchstone that connects us
to our small town family, where a story is always waiting on the porch swing,
where stories are renewed and preserved for another generation.
