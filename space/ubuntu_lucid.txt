I recently upgraded from
[Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com/)
[Hardy](https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/about-ubuntu/C/) (8.04) to
[Lucid](https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/about-ubuntu/C/) (10.04). Similar to
my list of tips for [Fedora Core 3 on VMWare](fedora_core_3_on_vmware), here are 
some tips for Ubuntu Lucid. (I'm running it on a
[Thinkpad X201](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/landing_pages/thinkpad/2010/X201-X201s-X201tablet)).

  * If you use [VMWare](http://vmware.com/), don't bother with trying to build
VMWare tools. Instead, use 
[Open VM Tools](http://open-vm-tools.sourceforge.net/), an open source version.
There are lucid packages - open-vm-tools for console, open-vm-toolbox for X -
that are built with the right kernel, 2.6.31, and work flawlessly.
[Thanks langui.sh!](http://langui.sh/2009/10/05/ubuntu-9-10-in-vmware/)


  * If you want to remove [GDM](http://gnome.org/projects/gdm/) and boot to a
console login prompt instead of an X splash screen, there's yet another
new incantation. This time, the recommended practice is to muck with grub
itself:

        sudo sed -i -r 's/(GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=)"quiet splash"/\1"test"/' \
          /etc/default/grub
        sudo update-grub

  * Sound has pretty much Just Worked, which was a pleasant surprise.
Specifically, [PulseAudio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PulseAudio) worked out
of the box. Of course, I immediately broke it by running `pactl
set-sink-volume`. I got error messages like _shm\_open(): Permission denied_
when I ran `paplay` and other sound applications. Argh. I reinstalled soon
after, so I didn't get the chance to debug farther.

  * There's no more `xorg.conf`! It's deprecated. Use other tools to configure
X, e.g. `xrandr` to set resolution.

  * At first, all of my GTK apps had huge fonts. Readers Digest huge. Firefox,
Pidgin, everything. I was using `xrandr` to set my screen resolution, since I
use [xinit](http://xfree86.org/current/xinit.1.html) and a non-standard window
manager, [ion](ion), instead of a full desktop like Gnome or KDE, so I wondered
if i was Doing It Wrong. It was only GTK fonts, so I dug into
[gconf](http://projects.gnome.org/gconf/). I tried
[using gconftool](http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2008/01/10/gconftool-2-gconf-editor-from-the-shell/)
to change them:

        gconf-editor /desktop/gnome/interface/font_name
        gconftool -t int -s /desktop/gnome/interface/font_size 12

    ...but that didn't work, maybe because `xrandr` changes resolution but not
DPI, or something similar related to scaling.

    I [continued](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution)
[researching](http://www.x.org/wiki/FAQVideoModes) and experimenting. I tried
running `xrandr` _after_ starting the programs, in `.xinitrc`, and it worked!
...but it didn't last. As soon as I restarted a program, it had monster fonts
again.

    After more wailing and gnashing of teeth, I finally struck on a solution. I
reused my `xorg.conf` from Hardy, and that fixed it for good. Woohoo! Of course,
when I later switched from [VMWare](http://vmware.com/) to running on bare
hardware, it fixed itself and I no longer needed the `xorg.conf`. Go figure.

  * Speaking of [gconf](http://projects.gnome.org/gconf/), note how it's
different from the old school `.gtkrc` files! gconf is only really used if
you're running Gnome. Of course, more and more things are "part of Gnome" and
use it, like PulseAudio, but others like Pidgin and Firefox don't. they read
`.gtkrc-2.0` instead.

  * This [Emacs 23/GTK bug](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85715)
[more](http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=4078)
[details](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/emacs23/+bug/543611) annoyed
the shit out of me. When server-based X frames are killed instead of closed
nicely, e.g. with e.g. `server-edit`, the whole Emacs process hangs. This
happens when i shut down X while any X emacsclient frames are still open. the
symptom is that the next time I try to open an X emacsclient frame, it just
hangs. Grr.

    <!-- http://groups/emacs-users/browse_thread/thread/ebe5e2b927c824d3 -->

    I tried lots of workarounds, but I finally fixed this by switching to the
`emacs-lucid` package, which is emacs with X windows support but no GTK. It uses
[Xaw](http://www.x.org/archive/X11R6.8.1/doc/Xaw.3.html) as its windowing
toolkit instead. Praise the lord!


  * If you're using VMWare
[shared folders](http://www.vmware.com/support/ws5/doc/ws_running_shared_folders.html),
and boot complains that `/mnt/hgfs` can't be mounted and prompts to
skip, it might be because `mountall` starts before `open-vm-tools`, so it
doesn't have the fs driver loaded yet. Try
[adding the `nobootwait` option in `/etc/fstab`](http://dmoonc.com/blog/?p=298).

  * The `pm-utils` package has command-line tools for suspend, `pm-suspend`, and
hibernate, `pm-hibernate`, and even a hybrid of the two, `pm-suspend-hybrid`.
Awesome.

  * Speaking of suspend, if you're on a
[Thinkpad](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/landing_pages/thinkpad/) (I use an
[X201](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/landing_pages/thinkpad/2010/X201-X201s-X201tablet)),
and your laptop reboots when you resume from suspend, update your BIOS.

  * If your screen turns off after 10 minutes, or however long, check your X
  screen saver and DPMS settings:

        $ xset q
        Screen Saver:
          prefer blanking: yes  allow exposures: yes
          timeout: 600  cycle: 600
        ...
        DPMS (Energy Star):
          Standby: 600  Suspend: 600  Off: 600
          DPMS is Enabled

    Turn both off with:

        xset -dpms
        xset s off


  * To disable bluetooth, make sure `/etc/rc.local` is executable, then add this
  line to it:

        echo disable > /proc/acpi/ibm/bluetooth

  * If you're getting logged out when your session goes idle, that's because of
  timeoutd. To configure it, edit `/etc/timeouts`; to disable it, just truncate
  that file.

  * In earlier kernels, USB would stop working after suspend and resume.
Rebooting or hibernating and thawing would fix it. Details in
[these](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/252341)
[bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/566149).

  This turned out to be an ACPI bug that was fixed in a later kernel,
upstream 2.6.31.14 aka Ubuntu 2.6.32-23-generic. You can get it with
`sudo apt-get update` followed by either `sudo apt-get install linux-image`
or just `sudo apt-get upgrade`.

  * Speaking of USB, when I plug in my USB keyboard, my `xmodmap` settings
  aren't re-applied. See the
[launchpad bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/287215).
I haven't yet figured this out. I first tried switching to xkb, but
[it's](http://www.xfree86.org/current/XKB-Config2.html#3)
[too](http://www.x.org/wiki/XKB)
[damn](http://www.charvolant.org/~doug/xkb/html/index.html)
[complicated](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RemapCapsLock).

    Then I tried a
[udev rule](http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html):

        SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{product}=="Goldtouch USB Keyboard", RUN+="/usr/bin/xmodmap /home/ryanb/.Xmodmap"

    but no luck. I noticed a comment in
[the launchpad bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/287215)
that said a udev rule like this might run too soon, so I tried slowing it down
by pointing it to this script (udev's man page says that `RUN` doesn't use a
shell):

        #!/bin/sh
        sleep 15s && xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap &

    It definitely ran, but it didn't actually work. Confusing. I finally gave up
and added a key binding in my window manager to run `xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap` on
demand, and I just press that after I plug in my keyboard.

  * If you're on a laptop, you can use the
[tp_smapi](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Tp_smapi#Battery_charge_control_features)
kernel module to tune your battery charge thresholds and increase
its lifespan. First, install the tp-smapi module, load it, and tell Linux to
load it on boot:

        # as root
        apt-get install tp-smapi-dkms
        modprobe tp_smapi
        echo "tp_smapi" >> /etc/modules

  You can configure it with [sysfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs). For
example, to charge the battery when it's below 90% and never charge it above 95%:

        echo 90 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/start_charge_thresh
        echo 95 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/stop_charge_thresh

  See the [ThinkWiki article](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Tp_smapi#Battery_charge_control_features)
for more. To
[keep these settings across reboot](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Tp_smapi#Making_the_settings_permanent_on_reboot),
use [sysfsutils](http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net/Sysfsutils.html):

        # as root
        apt-get install sysfsutils
        cat >> /etc/sysfs.conf << EOF
        devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/start_charge_thresh = 90
        devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/stop_charge_thresh = 95
        EOF

  * On a related note, you can use
[acpid](http://mindspill.net/computing/linux-notes/acpi/)
to warn you, or even automatically suspend or hibernate, when your battery gets
low. See
[this article](http://mindspill.net/computing/linux-notes/acpi/acpi-low-battery-warning.html).

  I decided to automatically suspend when my battery drops to around 5%.
First, use `service acpid status` to make sure acpid is installed and running.
Next, add a new acpid event by creating a new file,
`/etc/acpi/events/low_battery_suspend`, with these contents:

        event=battery.*
        action=/etc/acpi/low-battery-suspend.sh %e

  Finally, put this into `/etc/acpi/low-battery-suspend.sh`:

        PROC=/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0
        CURRENT=`grep -E '^remaining capacity:' $PROC/state | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f3`
        LOW=`grep -E '^design capacity warning:' $PROC/info | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f4`
        CHARGING=`grep -E '^charging state:' $PROC/state | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f3`
        
        if [[ $CHARGING == "discharging" && $CURRENT -lt $LOW ]]; then
          pm-suspend-hybrid
        fi

  * Last power saving tip: check out Intel's
[powertop](http://www.linuxpowertop.org/), a utility that acts like top for your
battery. It shows you the biggest power consumers on your system and
[suggests remedies](http://www.linuxpowertop.org/known.php), e.g.
[USB power save mode](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_reduce_power_consumption#USB_Subsystem)
(usually just for non-input devices),
[HD audio power save mode](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1477894):

        echo 1 > /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_savep
        
  and [SATA low power mode](http://www.lesswatts.org/tips/disks.php):

        echo min_power > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy


Enjoy Ubuntu Lucid!
