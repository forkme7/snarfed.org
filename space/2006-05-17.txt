### E3 2006 [![Icon-Permalink.png](/Icon-Permalink.png)](#)

I didn't go to [E3](http://e3expo.com/) this year, but thanks to sites like
[Google Video](http://video.google.com/), I don't have to settle for news bites
and first impressions. I can watch the [full-length press
conferences](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=e3+2006+conference) from
Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, as well as [in-depth
tours](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=e3+2006+booth) of almost every
booth at the show. (OK, except maybe [Kentia
Hall](http://www.penny-arcade.com/2006/05/15).) What more could an armchair
pundit want?

So, without further ado, here are my [thoughts on E3 2006](/space/E3+2006).
