### Off to GDC [![Icon-Permalink.png](/Icon-Permalink.png)](#)

[![/space/gdc.png](/space/gdc.png)](http://gdconf.com/)

I'll be at [GDC](http://gdconf.com/), Game Developers Conference, next week. I
can't wait! This will be my sixth year, and I've written up the
[last](/space/GDC+2005) [two](/space/GDC+2006), so I'll probably write up this
one as well. If you'll be there, [drop me a line](/space/contact)!
