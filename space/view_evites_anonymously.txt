Does it ever give you the creeps
that, whenever you get an [evite](http://evite.com/), it knows who you are?
Worse, if you forward an evite link to a friend, when they view it, they can
change your reply, or even your evite profile!

To view an evite anonymously, remove the **&src=...** parameter from the URL (if
any) and add **&unknownUser=true** to the end. This link is also safe to send to
friends. (That's not as important any more, though since most evites let you
invite other people "officially.")
