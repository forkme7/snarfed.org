Tigelleria

Becca and I went out to an intriguing new restaurant,
[Tigelleria](http://tigelleria.com/)
([Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tigelleria-ristorante-campbell)),
a few nights ago. It's Italian, "100% organic," and specializes in
[tigelle](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigelle) (_tee-jell-ay_), a dish
originating in northern Italy that consists of flatbread stuffed with various
fillings and tapenades.

We were new to tigelle, so we covered our bases and ordered cheeses, vegetables,
and a side of prosciutto. The cheeses ran the gamut from soft goat's milk to
hard Parmesan, and came with sweet apple, pear, and fig tapenades. The
vegetables were sliced impossibly thin, grilled with olive oil and basil, and
came with tomato and olive tapenades and hummus. The tigelle itself was
unremarkable, but very good, and fresh from the oven.

By themselves, none of the ingredients particularly stood out. Combined
together with a tapenade in the tigelle, though, they turned out to be much
more than the sum of our parts. We spent the whole meal trying out different
combinations, and we were hard pressed to find a single one we didn't like.

When dessert rolled around, the
[caffe d'orzo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orzo#Orzo_roasted_barley_drink)
immediately caught my eye. It's a caffeine-free faux espresso brewed with
roasted barley, originally considered a poor person's drink but now a trendy,
healthier alternative to coffee.

It was...interesting. Not for me, but definitely interesting, and I'm glad I
tried it. Happily, the tiramisu more than made up for it.

Overall, we loved the food, the atmosphere, the service, and the new things we
discovered. The novelty may eventually give way to familiarity, but still, we're
excited to go back!
