Becca and I went out to an intriguing new restaurant,
[Tigelleria](http://tigelleria.com/)
([Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tigelleria-ristorante-campbell)),
a few nights ago. It's Italian, "100% organic," and specializes in
[tigelle](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigelle), a dish originating in northern
Italy that consists of flatbread stuffed with various fillings and tapenades.

We were new to tigelle, so we covered our bases and ordered cheeses, vegetables,
and a side of prosciutto. The cheeses ran the gamut from soft goat's milk to
hard Parmesan, and came with sweet apple, pear, and fig tapenades. The
vegetables were sliced impossibly thin, grilled with olive oil and basil, and
came with tomato and olive tapenades and hummus. The tigelle itself was
good, if unremarkable, and fresh from the oven.

None of the ingredients themselves particularly stood out. Combined with the
tigelle and tapenade, though, they were much better than the sum of their
parts. We spent the meal trying all the different combinations, and we were
hard pressed to find a single one we didn't like.

When dessert rolled around, the
[caffe d'orzo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orzo#Orzo_roasted_barley_drink)
immediately caught my eye. It's a caffeine-free faux espresso brewed with
roasted barley, originally considered a poor person's drink but now a trendy,
healthier alternative to coffee.

It was...interesting. Not for me, but definitely interesting, and worth trying.
Happily, the tiramisu more than made up for it.

Overall, we loved the food, the atmosphere, the service, and the new things we
discovered. The novelty will fade eventually, but still, we're excited to go
back!
