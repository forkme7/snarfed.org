PAX 2004

[Maulik](Maulik) and I went to [Penny Arcade Expo
2004](http://penny-arcade.com/pax/), in Seattle. We hung out with
[Sam](sam_z_glassenberg) and hit the nightlife, but mostly we just
played lots of video games. See the [news post](2004-09-07_twisp_catsby_and_halo_2) for a bigger
description.
