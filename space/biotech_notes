hey XXX, thanks for taking the time to talk with me! it was great to catch up with you, and i really appreciated hearing from someone who does real work in the field. i'll definitely let you know if i start thinking about anything concrete.

i'm including a few notes i typed up. feel free to add anything, and thanks again!

genomics: still interesting!
- SNPs are single bases, but variations are often much bigger than that
- finding genes and gene patterns that correlate

biomarkers: any interesting bio signal. gene, hormone levels, protein
  expression, etc.
- devices for detecting them
- correlating them with x, y, z, ...
- consumer device for measuring lots of these? devices used during FDA trials
  for correlating data? theranos (?) startup doing this?

derive something to direct drug development public datasets (from basic research)
- search engine over all theoretically possible molecules proteins? as opposed
  to e.g. existing catalogs that only have known ones.
- enumerate bonding sites for molecules/proteins?

NLP/data mining over research papers, pubmed, etc
- derive semantics. e.g. lots of activity around X in late '90s, then it was all
  discredited in 2000. if you search, you may find the '90s stuff and not see
  that it was discredited.

help find subpopulations that drugs should be targeted at
- lucy's friend sherry's company did this, worked great
- specifically: which biomarkers? genes, etc

help direct/predict results of early (and late) fda trials
- ie should they use rats, dogs, other animals? should they look for specific
  biomarkers? etc.
- drug developer gets to control pre-trials and give input to later ones
- if big improvement, fda supports this

use simulation of subsystems (entire body model is holy grail) to test virtually
- most likely is maybe drug interactions, e.g. one to one molecules or one to
  many, not simulating entire system

protein folding
- predicting/computing 3d structure, critical for identifying interactions,
  bonding sites, etc
- another holy grail, but way too big a problem

identifying all expressed proteins
- so far we have 1k/30k
- human proteome project: computationally enumerate them all?

neuropace: makes neural devices that prevent epileptic seizures
- detect early signs of seizures (neurological patterns of brain waves), sends
  electrical "tickle" that stops it before it starts.
- can record and upload lots of neurological data based on heuristics, e.g. at
  certain time every day, around a specific kind of pattern, etc.
- location in brain: epilepsy is focused but varies by patient, so different
  place depending on the person
- looking into other applications: parkinson's, etc. new approvals for each
  application but easier based on generic results (e.g. safety) from previous
  approvals.

side project: better, less invasive catheter for babies
- got NIH grant in dec 2010, waiting on budget to get funds

big picture interest: cost of health care
- high and rising in developed nations. not sustainable!
- expensive, targeted treatments (e.g. neuropace, narrow cancer drugs) not the
  way forward

micro-ecosystems inside big health care institutions
- e.g. kaiser, VA
- lots of longitudinal data on patients: conditions they had, treatments,
  results. valuable for data mining.
- nothing public or semi-public like pubmed though

jean (friend at mckinsey)'s project: global database of health care practices
- started with individual studies and projects
- now looking to build an ongoing, self-sustaining database

fda approval: bane of industry
- too costly, slow, erratic (unqualified reviewers), long iteration time, etc
- also, business model and employment structure doesn't fit cyclical
  development. right now mostly full time employees, but more modular structure
  like hollywood would fit better.
