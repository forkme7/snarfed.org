genomics: still interesting!
- SNPs are single bases, but variations are often much bigger than that
- finding genes and gene patterns that correlate

biomarkers: any interesting bio signal. gene, hormone levels, protein
  expression, etc.
- devices for detecting them
- correlating them with x, y, z, ...
- consumer device for measuring lots of these? devices used during FDA trials
  for correlating data? theranos (?) startup doing this?

derive something to direct drug development public datasets (from basic research)
- enumerate bonding sites for molecules/proteins?
- search engine over all theoretically possible molecules proteins? as opposed
  to e.g. existing catalogs that only have known ones.

NLP/data mining over research papers, pubmed, etc
- derive semantics. e.g. lots of activity around X in late '90s, then it was all
  discredited in 2000. if you search, you may find the '90s stuff and not see
  that it was discredited.

help find subpopulations that drugs should be targeted at
- lucy's friend sherry's company did this, worked great
- specifically: which biomarkers? genes, etc

help direct/predict results of early (and late) fda trials
- ie should they use rats, dogs, other animals? should they look for specific
  biomarkers? etc.
- drug developer gets to control pre-trials and give input to later ones
- if big improvement, fda supports this

use simulation of subsystems (entire body model is holy grail) to test virtually
- most likely is maybe drug interactions, e.g. one to one molecules or one to
  many, not simulating entire system

protein folding
- predicting/computing 3d structure, critical for identifying interactions,
  bonding sites, etc
- another holy grail, but way too big a problem

identifying all expressed proteins
- so far we have 1k/30k
- human proteome project: computationally enumerate them all?
