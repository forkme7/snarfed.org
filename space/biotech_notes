hey XXX! hope you're doing well.

i've been talking to people a bit about biotech recently - computational bio and how it can relate drug discovery and development, for example, but i'm trying to learn as broadly as i can. i'd love to grab lunch or coffee or drinks and talk for a bit if you have time. how does next week look?

thanks in advance...


hey XXX, thanks for taking the time to talk with me! it was great to catch up with you, and i really appreciated hearing from someone who does real work in the field. i'll definitely let you know if i start thinking about anything concrete.

i'm including a few notes i typed up. feel free to add anything, and thanks again!



lunch w/maureen hillenmeyer and lucy page southworth, 6/27/2011

at stanford genetics center, maureen's working on synthetic bio

genomics: still interesting!
- SNPs are single bases, but variations are often much bigger than that
- finding genes and gene patterns that correlate

biomarkers: any interesting bio signal. gene, hormone levels, protein
  expression, etc.
- devices for detecting them
- correlating them with x, y, z, ...
- consumer device for measuring lots of these? devices used during FDA trials
  for correlating data? theranos (?) startup doing this?

derive something to direct drug development public datasets (from basic research)
- search engine over all theoretically possible molecules proteins? as opposed
  to e.g. existing catalogs that only have known ones.
- enumerate bonding sites for molecules/proteins?

NLP/data mining over research papers, pubmed, etc
- derive semantics. e.g. lots of activity around X in late '90s, then it was all
  discredited in 2000. if you search, you may find the '90s stuff and not see
  that it was discredited.

help find subpopulations that drugs should be targeted at
- lucy's friend sherry's company did this, worked great
- specifically: which biomarkers? genes, etc

help direct/predict results of early (and late) fda trials
- ie should they use rats, dogs, other animals? should they look for specific
  biomarkers? etc.
- drug developer gets to control pre-trials and give input to later ones
- if big improvement, fda supports this

use simulation of subsystems (entire body model is holy grail) to test virtually
- most likely is maybe drug interactions, e.g. one to one molecules or one to
  many, not simulating entire system

protein folding
- predicting/computing 3d structure, critical for identifying interactions,
  bonding sites, etc
- another holy grail, but way too big a problem

identifying all expressed proteins
- so far we have 1k/30k
- human proteome project: computationally enumerate them all?

at neuropace: makes neural devices that prevent epileptic seizures
- detect early signs of seizures (neurological patterns of brain waves), sends
  electrical "tickle" that stops it before it starts.
- can record and upload lots of neurological data based on heuristics, e.g. at
  certain time every day, around a specific kind of pattern, etc.
- location in brain: epilepsy is focused but varies by patient, so different
  place depending on the person
- looking into other applications: parkinson's, etc. new approvals for each
  application but easier based on generic results (e.g. safety) from previous
  approvals.

side project: better, less invasive catheter for babies
- got NIH grant in dec 2010, waiting on budget to get funds

big picture interest: cost of health care
- high and rising in developed nations. not sustainable!
- expensive, targeted treatments (e.g. neuropace, narrow cancer drugs) not the
  way forward

micro-ecosystems inside big health care institutions
- e.g. kaiser, VA
- lots of longitudinal data on patients: conditions they had, treatments,
  results. valuable for data mining.
- nothing public or semi-public like pubmed though

jean (friend at mckinsey)'s project: global database of health care practices
- started with individual studies and projects
- now looking to build an ongoing, self-sustaining database

fda approval: bane of industry
- too costly, slow, erratic (unqualified reviewers), long iteration time, etc
- also, business model and employment structure doesn't fit cyclical
  development. right now mostly full time employees, but more modular structure
  like hollywood would fit better.



dinner w/steph mycclymont, 7/14/2011

at ucsf diabetes center
- basic research on autoimmune disorders
- type 1 diabetes is main application, MS another
- looks at proteins expressed by certain cells

her center is developing a cell treatment, looking for broken T cells, fixing
them and reinserting them into patients

bio researchers generally think computational has promise, more funding going
into interdisciplinary

one common problem with merging existing data is lack of calibration of
measurements across device types and labs. an automated way of normalizing
after the fact would be nice.

biomarkers very useful, common to lots of treatments, research. could be
useful for identifying subpopulations for trials, etc.

global databases for biomarkers or proteins would definitely be useful.

agrees that there's a lot left to do in genetics
- e.g. whole gene sequencing
- researchers have identified key genes in certain diseases by comparing genes
-   of family members, one who has a given disease vs another who doesn't
- expects whole genome sequencing to become more common

epigenetics
- extra hereditary information encoded in histome proteins, which pack dna
- some dna sequences are "compacted," ie packed tighter away and less used or
    unused

agrees that processing public datasets to try to direct drug development could
be promising, not a lot of it going on yet. example: leukemia drug from pfizer
right now. certain kinase protein causes cells to become cancerous. they found
a certain part of that kinase that they could develop a drug to target and
inhibit. promising for other cancers, but the vulnerable part of the protein
is kind of unique, so they haven't yet found similar vulnerable parts in other
cancer-causing proteins.



lunch w/jed pitera, 7/15/2011

at ibm research almaden, used to do protein folding and related simulation,
now on materials science and polymers

interesting research right now on whole cell modeling, fleshing out all of the
mechanisms involved. long term, ambitious, projects focus on individual parts
right now. one problem is it doesn't necessarily help you so much with larger
organisms, since the same kind of cell may have many different states (active
or quiscient, etc), and it's not obvious how to get that set of states.

protein structure is also useful, most proteins have one or a few different
structures (ie folding patterns), but some switch between a few structures,
and are sometimes unstructured, and each structure has a different function.

systems bio was modeling with PDEs, etc, didn't work so well

it's also doing experiments en masse - set up and then measure a bunch of
bondings, expressions, etc in a single pass, then measure everything after the
fact and see what happened and what didn't

epigenetics: methylation levels of genes can turn production on/off,
  change rate, sometimes even the protein's structure itself, by affecting
  stages of the protein creation process

drug discovery/development pipelines: once you have a target, figuring out
what kind of molecule to build to address that target is pretty
straightforward. *however*, identifying targets is much less so. current
techniques:
- historical. find someone who's been working on that disease or condition for
  a while, they will already have it narrowed down
- educated guess and check. look for other gene sequences or molecules that
  look similar to a known baseline, then use those as candidates

EHR aggregation and data mining is promising, example datasets include kaiser,
VA, military health care. identify signals like doctor decisions, etc, then
measure against outcomes and care success rates.

NCI: national cancer institute has what amounts to a drug pipeline for hire,
something like pro bono/self-publishing drug discovery, e.g. for orphaned
diseases or other people who aren't big pharma and can't keep the entire
pipeline busy permanently themselves. they see lots of people come in with
targets, they'd be good to talk to.

synthetic bio is interesting, but more on the engineering side, e.g. energy,
drug manufacturing (use e. coli, more efficient than growing whole plants)

background in inhalables and protein/peptide drug delivery
currently runs Dance Pharmaceuticals and InCarda CardioTherapeutics
previously Nektar Therapeutics and Genentech
 
unofficial (rough, incomplete) pecking order at big biotech: cloning people,
cell biologists, then clinical people, then pharmacologists, then delivery
people, then formulators at the bottom.

friend vijay ramakrishnan at stanford has 3x3 matrix for personalizing drug
prescriptions, based on monoclonal antibodies. pikamab.com. could hurt rituxan
sales.

standard timeline and cost complaints about regulatory climate and fda trials.
record is 4.5 years. makes the VC community and process problematic; they want
quick turnover, biotech and drug discovery startups can't be quick.

genomic health in palo alto. did number crunching over genomic data for
predictive diagnostics, primarily cancer. finally have meta analyses of results,
unclear whether they're much better than placebo.

number crunching existing datasets to help with discovery? unlikely to succeed
because bio is so complex. genomics, proteomics, metabolome, epigenetics, etc
all have largely failed to provide big clinical breakthroughs.

personalized is the future! stratifying and targeting different drugs, dosages,
etc. to subpopulations is really important. e.g. rituxan, blockbuster
genentech's cancer drug, only works well in 5% of people, ok in 30%, not at all
on rest, still prescribed to everyone.

lots of fads in biotech. SIRNA is recent example, merck bought startup for
1.1b, shut it down recently. too big to deliver into cells, biology much too
complex.

interested in medical social networks, connecting people with similar diseases,
genes, etc, and comparing their experiences. similar to 23andme.

also interested in gerontology. hormone levels drop when you age. hormone
replacement therapy could help, but people worry hormones would cause cancer
acceleration. it's pure theory though. maybe some older people in the field are
already quietly taking growth hormone to combat aging.
