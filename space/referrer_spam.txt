referrer spam

[Referrer spam](http://www.spywareinfo.com/articles/referer_spam/) - or by
Apache's original misspelling, _referer_ spam - has been a problem at
snarfed.org for years. I use [Summary](http://summary.net/) for web analytics,
and I made its statistic pages publicly available for a while, so spammers
still hit this site fake referrers, to this day, hoping that they'll be linked
from the Summary pages.

There are a number of approaches to fighting referrer spam, but so far, no
silver bullet. Here's what I did while my Summary output was online.

  * I maintained a hand-edited blacklist of known spammers' sites. It's far
from ideal, but it worked. You can find my blacklist in my
[summary.conf](summary.conf) file. If you're fighting
referrer spam, feel free to borrow it. (I used to use
[webalizer](http://webalizer.com/); my
[webalizer.conf](webalizer.conf) is also available,
but it's not maintained.)

  * I've written a [webalizer nofollow patch](webalizer_nofollow_patch)
that adds support for the popular new
[nofollow](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html)
tag.

  * I _used to_ use
[iptables](http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&start=1&q=http://www.netfilter.org/)
to blacklist known spammers' IP addresses and subnets, such as marketscore.com,
bezeqint.net, and ac.at.

  * I'd eventually like to use existing blacklist and referrer spam tools, such
as [Jay Allen's](http://www.jayallen.org/)
[MT-Blacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/). However, most of those
tools are specific to [MovableType](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/) and
[Apache](http://apache.org/), and this site uses [SnipSnap](SnipSnap)
instead.

  * A better approach would be to write tools that operate directly on referrer
logs, so they can be used with any web server or CMS and any web analytics
package. [Tony Buser](http://juju.org/)'s
[derefspam.pl](http://www.juju.org/archives/2005/01/21/derefspam) script is a
good first step. I'd like to extend it to use DNSBLs and RBLs like
[Spamhaus](http://www.spamhaus.org/xbl/index.lasso),
[BSB](http://bsb.empty.us/), [Blitzed](http://opm.blitzed.org/info), and
[SURBL](http://www.surbl.org/faq.html).
