I ran in the [Urban Iditarod](http://www.urbaniditarod.com/) on Saturday! Here
in San Francisco, we don't have the facilities to run a [real Alaskan
Iditarod](http://www.iditarod.com/). Still, we're not about to give up, so we
make a few compromises and run our very own race.

For the better part of the day, hundreds of us did our best to turn into real
Alaskan sled dogs. I wore a coat of fur, barked as loud as i could, stuck my
tongue out and panted, howled at the moon, and sniffed a few other dogs' butts.
After that warm up, I strapped myself into a lead attached to a shopping cart
and ran for my life. Oh, and I also drank copious amounts of beer. :P

The iditarod was a smaller, themed version of [Bay to
Breakers](http://www.baytobreakers.com/). Along those lines, it was less
organized, but the underground feel added lots of energy and spontaneity. When
everyone's dressed up as a dog in some way or other, inhibitions drop pretty
quickly.

The race felt like giant obstacle course - pedestrians, tourists, drivers, cable
cars, police, even other carts and dogs were just speed bumps on the path. We
definitely surprised everyone on the route, and it was great fun to yell at
onlookers to "mush, you huskies, mush!" Some even ran with us for a block or so.

Pictures coming soon. I'm looking forward to next year!
