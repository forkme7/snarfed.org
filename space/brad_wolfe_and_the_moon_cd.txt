Brad Wolfe is a friend from college who's a strikingly gifted singer/songwriter.
He's been successful on the
[local circuit](2004-07-04_brad_wolfe_and_stan_smith) in the bay area, and he's
threatening to turn his love of music into an actual career. His band,
[Brad Wolfe and the Moon](http://bradwolfemusic.com/), is reminiscent of artists
like [David Gray](http://www.davidgray.com/),
[John Mayer](http://www.johnmayer.com/),
[Jack Johnson](http://www.jackjohnsonmusic.com/), and fellow Stanfordite
[Stan Smith](http://lineofsightmusic.com/).

I got Brad's first real CD in the mail today, and it's really, really good.
Highlights include _Tall Grass_, _In The Middle of a Dream_, and _Caroline_,
among others. Four of the thirteen songs were originally released on his
[demo](http://www.freedb.org/freedb_search_fmt.php?cat=folk&id=4605b206), and I
actually prefer the demo recordings of a few of them, but that's a small bone to
pick with an otherwise standout album.

If you like Brad's music, you might also like
[Chris Babson](Chris_Babson_-_Perfectly).

[cddb](http://cddb.com/) still doesn't list Brad, but
[freedb](http://freedb.org/) has both the
[demo](http://www.freedb.org/freedb_search_fmt.php?cat=folk&id=4605b206) and the
[album](http://www.freedb.org/freedb_search_fmt.php?cat=folk&id=3a0e7715). At
the risk of being redundant, here's the discography.
