I use [Pine](http://www.washington.edu/pine/) as my email client, and I really
like it. It's fast, simple, full-featured, and very keyboardable. However,
nothing's perfect, even Pine.

Pine 4.60 added support for flowed text a la
[RFC2646](http://zvon.org/tmRFC/RFC2646/Output/index.html), which is great. If
you want, you can tell it not to send flowed text...but there's no way to tell
it not to _display_ flowed text. This patch adds that option.

There are also [pre-built packages](http://www.quantumlinux.com/~chuckw/pine/)
with this patch, thanks to Chuck Wolber, and [instructions on building Pine from
source](pine_reply-all_patch). Scroll to the bottom.
