_This is part of my [Unwriting series](2012-08-11_unwriting), which means it's
rough and probably not worth reading. If anything, skim it._

In [our last episode](2012-08-13_technology_makes_us_more_who_we_are), I
discussed how technology helps us reclaim so much of our time and energy, and
what that means. Along with a few other things, technology is one reason I'm so
damn lucky to have such a good life. I feel healthy, secure, stable, confident,
comfortable, challenged, engaged, and just plain happy - or at least content -
almost all the time.

Technology is far from the only contributor. Genes, environment, socioeconomic
status, friends and family, and good old dumb luck all played big parts. Still,
for whatever reason, life is good.

I'm not just thinking about the macro level. Even minute by minute, when I
examine how I spend my time, the vast majority of it is positive.
