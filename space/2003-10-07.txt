### Lojack...for me!

Have you ever had that nagging feeling in the back of your mind? You know the
one. You locked him up, he's safe in the garage...but you're still a little
worried that one of these days, the alarm might malfunction, or someone might
clone your garage door opener, and Ryan might get stolen?

Well, fear not. Introducing Lojack for Ryan! Simply check this [log of my aim
away messages](http://ryan.barrett.name/away.log), and you'll never have to
worry again.
