OpenIDDevCamp

I spent most of my weekend at [OpenIDDevCamp](http://barcamp.org/OpenIDDevCamp),
a get-together for [OpenID](http://openid.net/) people in the San Francisco
area. I've worked on a few OpenID projects, both
[inside work](/space/2007-12-02_openid_comments_in_blogger)
[and](/space/pyblosxom_openid_server)
[outside](/space/pyblosxom_openid_comments), so I dropped
by. I didn't have an agenda, but I figured I'd pitch in wherever there was
coding to be done.

It turned out to be a fun gathering. The attendees ranged from core
community members to newbies, and the activities ranged from usability design
to spec writing to general troubleshooting. I ended up working with
[Brad](http://bradfitz.com/), [David](http://davidrecordon.com/), and others
on an [interoperability test suite](http://code.google.com/p/openid-test/),
which we'll hopefully have up and running soon.

There are

that go into more detail, so  I'll just say that despite my hands yelling at me for
typing on a laptop for a weekend instead of my
[Goldtouch](http://goldtouch.com/), it was worth it. I had a great time.

Thanks to [Scott](http://kveton.com/),
[David](http://davidrecordon.com/), and
[Chris](http://factoryjoe.com/) for organizing!
