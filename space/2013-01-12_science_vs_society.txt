Science vs society

I just finished Thomas Sowell's
_[A Conflict Of Visions](http://books.google.com/books?id=NwrWDM8FW04C)_. Great
book.

He casually tossed off this point at the end, and it's stuck with me. I've been
thinking about the same idea for a long time, but it never crystallized quite
like this.

In other words, science builds consensus and makes progress by running
controlled, reproducible experiments. That's difficult to do in social science
and public policy, if not outright impossible. The progress we do make - human
rights, democracy, etc. - is probably due to improvements in trade, culture, and
communication rather than deliberately thinking up better ideas or policies.

A corollary is that we can't prove or disprove ideas in social science. We can't
even easily build consensus. That may seem discouraging, but I'm actually
optimistic about it. If it helps us lower our expectations, maybe we won't get
as upset when we can't agree and we fail to browbeat the "other side" into
submission.
