My sister, [Vanessa](http://vanessaart.com/), is an artist. Her work has hung in
number of galleries and other venues in the Bay Area, including
[Artescape](http://artescapestudios.com/), [The Red
Dragonfly](http://www.thereddragonfly.com/), and [Brainwash
Cafe](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=%22brainwash+cafe%22+94103&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&hl=en&latlng=37772540,-122414664,8710111387641920675).
I've been to most of her receptions and shows, and they're always a lot of fun.
It also doesn't hurt that I like her stuff. :P

On Sunday, Vanessa kicked off one of her largest exhibits to date: a [solo
show](http://www.wentevineyards.com/events.asp) at [Wente
Vineyards](http://www.wentevineyards.com/), one of the largest wineries in
Livermore.

Wente hung Vanessa's paintings in their [main tasting
room](http://www.wentevineyards.com/winery/estatetastingroom.asp), an oversized
area with a brick interior and earthy tones. It was the perfect backdrop for her
work. Over 100 people came, and Vanessa sold two paintings in the first two
hours.

Congratulations, Vaness! I can't wait for the next show...
