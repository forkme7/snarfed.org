I
love [Firefox](http://mozilla.org/firefox/)'s
[find-as-you-type](http://www.mozilla.org/access/type-ahead/), or
typeahead-find, feature. It's the sole reason that I switched to Firefox from
[Opera](http://opera.com/). Unfortunately, there's a problem with
find-as-you-type in Firefox 1.0PR. _Update: This is fixed in [Firefox 1.0.1 and
later](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/all.html)._

By default, find-as-you-type is turned off in Firefox. You can turn it on in the
advanced preferences, but then it defaults to searching both text and links, not
just links. You can change this by switching the hidden setting
**accessibility.typeaheadfind.linksonly** from false, to true. (To see this,
type [about:config](about:config) in the URL bar.)

This is all well and good. However, this setting
[broke](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=251073) in Firefox 1.0PR.
Luckily, the bug has been fixed, and while there isn't an official release with
the bugfix in it, you can pick up a [nightly
build](http://www.squarefree.com/burningedge/) that has the fix. I'm using
[2004-10-18](http://www.squarefree.com/burningedge/#000602), and it's working
great so far.
