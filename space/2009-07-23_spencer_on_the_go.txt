Last night,
[Clayton](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=508935265) and I had dinner at
[Spencer on the Go](http://www.spenceronthego.com/home.html),
the takeout arm of French restaurant
[Chez Spencer](https://chezspencer.net/home.php), in San Francisco.

Unlike most restaurants, you don't pick up Spencer's takeout at the host's
podium, or the register, or even at a side door or facade. Spencer on the Go
serves out of a taco truck!

Granted, it's a little classier than your average taco truck. The awning
features potted wheatrass, plates of fresh baked madeleines and cookies, and a
charming strand of christmas lights.

Still, it's simple and straightforward, and it lets the real star, the food,
shine through. The menu features French standbys like escargot, ratatouille,
foie gras, lamb stew, and even frog legs.

We tried a number of different dishes, and the pedigree was undoubtedly French -
heavy, buttery, and rich - and undoubtedly fit for foodies, most of whom
discovered Spencer on the Go a long time ago. More important than any of that,
though, it was really, really good.

There isn't much seating in the empty lot on 7th and Folsom,
but no matter. [City Beer](http://www.citybeerstore.com/) and
[Terroir](http://terroirsf.com/), the
[wine](/space/wine) bar we ended up going to, both
welcome Spencer's signature unmarked brown boxes.

It may not have been a conventional dinner, but it was a hell of a lot of fun,
and a great break from the standard restaurant experience. I can't wait to go
again.
