John and Julie's Wedding

John Tannaci and Julie Kliewer [were
married](http://weddings.theknot.com/pwp/view/co_main.aspx?coupleid=106610653775340)
on October 30, 2004. I was a groomsman, and managed to show up on time and not
make (too much of) a fool of myself. Here's the evidence!

([Pictures from the bachelor party](/gallery/John's Bachelor Party) are also up.)
