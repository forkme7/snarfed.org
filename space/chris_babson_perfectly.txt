[Chris Babson](http://www.soundclick.com/artist/8/chrisbabson.htm), a friend from
college, recently released his first CD,
[Perfectly](http://www.freedb.org/freedb_search_fmt.php?cat=rock&id=77077208).
Chris has been singing in theater and musicals for a while, but he's only
recently started songwriting. Even so, the CD is startlingly good. Chris
considers [Jason Mraz](http://jasonmraz.com/), [Marc
Broussard](http://www.islandrecords.com/marcbroussard/site/home.las), and
[Martin Sexton](http://www.martinsexton.com/) among his influences, but he's
definitely developed his own voice.

I heard Chris play live well before I heard him recorded, and he's a blast in
person. Even alone, armed with nothing more than a mic and an acoustic guitar,
Chris overflows with personality. His shows are incredible, due mostly to his
voice, his songwriting, and his larger-than-life stage presence.
