Every year, around the time the leaves start turning and the air gets crisp, my
birthday rolls around...and every year, when people ask what to get me, I'm
inevitably at a loss.

I like to count my blessings. I'm happy, healthy, I have a good job and a roof
over my head, so I don't really want for very much. That doesn't fly with
family, for example, who _have to get me a present, dammit, and why do I always
make this so hard on them_?!

For a while, I pointed them to my [books](/space/books),
[chocolate](/space/chocolate), and [games](/space/games) lists. That worked for
a bit, but they saw through it after a while. _That doesn't count_, they'd say,
_we're supposed to get you something good!_

Well, this year they outdid themselves. Along with an incredible
[homemade pecan galete](http://www.thecosmopolitancafe.com/sd_pages.cfm?pageid=109) and
[The Wire](http://hbo.com/thewire/) on DVD,
I received a [portrait](http://www.artwanted.com/imageview.cfm?id=400613&SubGal=Portraits)
from my sister. Even better,
[I can share it with you](http://www.artwanted.com/imageview.cfm?id=400613&SubGal=Portraits).

It's striking. It was a hit at the party, and everyone gushed about how much it
captured one of my most memorable expressions, and
[Ken](http://keeda.stanford.edu/~kash/)'s, with just a few brush
strokes. I can't wait to put it up in my office. Thanks,
[Vanessa](http://vanessaart.com/)!
