Every year, around the time the leaves start turning and the air turns crisp
and cool, I have a ritual. My birthday rolls around, friends and family ask
what to get me, and I'm always at a loss.

I like to count my blessings that don't want for anything - I'm happy, healthy,
I have a good job and a roof over my head - but that doesn't fly with parents
or siblings, for example, who _need to get me a present, dammit, and why do I
always have to make this so infuriatingly hard_?!

For a while, I pointed them to my [books](/space/books),
[chocolate](/space/chocolate), and [games](/space/games) lists. That worked for
a few years, but they saw through it afer a few years. _That doesn't count_,
they say, _we're supposed to get you something good!_

Well, this year they outdid themselves. Along with an incredible
[homemade pecan galete](http://www.thecosmopolitancafe.com/sd_pages.cfm?pageid=109) and
[The Wire](http://hbo.com/thewire/) DVDs,
I received a [portrait](/space/ryan_and_ken_painting.jpg)](http://www.artwanted.com/imageview.cfm?id=400613&SubGal=Portraits)
from my sister. Even better, it's a gift I can [share it with you](http://www.artwanted.com/imageview.cfm?id=400613&SubGal=Portraits).

It's striking. It was a hit at the party; everyone gushed about how much it
captured one of my most memorable expressions, and Ken's, with just a few brush
strokes. I can't wait to put it up in my office. Thanks,
