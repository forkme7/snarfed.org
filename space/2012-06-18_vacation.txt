Vacation

I'm heading out on vacation for the next month or so. If you're trying to find
me and can't, that's probably why.

We're sailing around the Cyclades in Greece for a while, than poking around
Venice, Florence, and wine country in Italy, and finally stopping in London on
our way back. I'm not sure why London either. I think all the future
Meditteranean warmth gave us heat stroke in the middle of planning and we got
confused.

We're hoping Greece can hang onto the Euro for a few more weeks before throwing
in the towel and pulling the drachmas out of mothballs. It looks like the
[New Democracy party won the election](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18482415),
which is good both for the world and for tourists like us. Still, we figure
they'll be so happy to see money coming _into_ the country,
[and not out of it](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-07/capital-flight-leaves-banks-in-germany-awash-in-cheap-deposits.html),
we'll probably get a small island or two for what we'd spend on t-shirts and
souvenirs elsewhere.

I know, I know, it's a tough life. Try to feel a little sorry for me.
