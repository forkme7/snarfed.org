Facebook app for OStatus?

Social networks are sprouting like weeds. I don't know about you, but I groan
every time I get a burst of invitations from the latest network du jour. I
usually ignore them, but I know I'm missing out on good conversations with my
early adopter friends.

I've always wanted just one profile and friend list, in one place, to connect to
friends anywhere. Email already does this; why can't social networking?

The short answer is, it can. The [OStatus](http://ostatus.org/about) suite of
federation protocols ([Salmon](http://salmon-protocol.org/),
[ActivityStreams](http://activitystrea.ms/), etc.) is the leading contender
right now. It hasn't been adopted by any of the majors yet, but I expect many
will gradually start supporting it, similar to [OpenID](http://openid.net/) and
[OAuth](http://oauth.net/).

Some won't, though. [Facebook](http://facebook.com/)'s track record with open
standards and data
[is](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_shouldnt_fear_opensocial.php)
[mixed](http://www.thedrum.co.uk/news/2011/07/11/23472-facebook-sets-up-roadblocks-to-stop-users-exporting-friends-to-google-/)
[at](http://opencompute.org/)
[best](http://developers.facebook.com/opensource/),
and their reputation isn't much better. Their
[API](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/), however, is comprehensive
enough that third party apps could easily implement bridges and even implement
fully federated protocols like OStatus.

Given that, it's odd that I
[can't find anyone who's done this yet](http://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+"ostatus").
I can think of a few reasons, namely the
[ban hammer](http://www.webpronews.com/facebook-ban-bot-like-google-panda-update-for-facebook-2011-06)
and the fact that individual users would need to opt in. Is there a bigger
reason I'm missing? Are the stakeholders pushing for official support instead,
or focusing on more feasible targets, or just too busy?

I've talked to a
[number](http://www.abstractioneer.org/)
[of](http://www.onebigfluke.com/)
[people](http://sporkmonger.com/) about this, and they don't think it's crazy.
I'm not trying to pick on Facebook, either. I'd love to do this for other major
sites like [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) and
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/) too.

I've started hacking on this a bit in my spare time. [Drop me a line](/about) if
you're interested in helping!
