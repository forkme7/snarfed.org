### Since I don't get to code at work...

I have [plenty](/space/synchronizing+mp3+playback)[ of](/space/gmail+vs+pine)
[projects](/space/ideas) to work on in my spare time...but recently, I've been
blowing them all off and playing with the [Python
Challenge](http://pythonchallenge.com/) instead. It's a set of riddles that can
be solved with a little [Python](http://python.org/) code, a little creativity,
and for me, lots of visits to the [forums](http://pythonchallenge.com/forums/)
for hints. The riddles are surprisingly elegant and well-designed. Often you'll
get as little as a picture and a couple words to start off with, but the riddle
will slowly unfold as you track down leads. As a scavenger hunt for the geek
set, it's a _lot_ of fun.
