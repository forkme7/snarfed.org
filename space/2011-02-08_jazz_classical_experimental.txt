Jazz, classical, and experimental

I've seen some good live music recently.
[Beethoven](http://www.sfsymphony.org/season/Event.aspx?eventid=43178) by the
[San Francisco Symphony](http://www.sfsymphony.org/),
[Roy Hargrove](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Hargrove)
[at Yoshi's](http://www.yoshis.com/sanfrancisco/jazzclub/artist/show/1651), and
the [Nels Cline Singers](http://www.nelsclinesingers.com/) and the
[Bottesini Project](http://www.thebottesiniproject.com/)
[at The Independent](http://www.ticketfly.com/event/22247). All interesting and
worthwhile, all strikingly different. It's been fun to think about how, and why.

I go to the symphony regularly, and I've
[written about it already](/?s=symphony), so I won't belabor the point. Suffice
it to say, Beethoven may run the gamut, but he was undeniably a master, and
[the pieces we heard](http://www.sfsymphony.org/season/Event.aspx?eventid=43178)
were no exception.

A few weeks later, we went to Yoshi's
[to see Roy Hargrove](http://www.yoshis.com/sanfrancisco/jazzclub/artist/show/1651),
one of the best jazz trumpeters around. I love jazz, but I hadn't been to a show
in a while, so I enjoyed it. It got me thinking about the differences between
jazz and classical. Plenty of ink has been spilled about that before, by people
much smarter than me, but that's never stopped me before.

Both are very technical. Classical has a wide range, but jazz may be a bit
narrower and more homogenous, both the genre and individual songs. They contrast
a fairly rigid, high level structure with looser, free form bars and measures.
Unlike classical, improvisation is common.

Some of the most interesting parts are the smallest ones. Like contemporary
classical music, jazz uses its own scales, chord progressions, and rhythms. Its
musicians aren't afraid to tweak and even abuse their instruments to get
strange, exhilarating sounds. Theyy're not unlike circus performers, all the way
down to drum rolls and spotlights for solos.

The [show at The Independent](http://www.ticketfly.com/event/22247) was easily
the most interesting of the three. What we heard is evidently called
"experimental," but that may be too kind. They abused their instruments and made
strange sounds too, but they never managed any musicality or rhythm. They'd play
a single riff for minutes on end, with little to no variation, then explode into
wild, dissonant cacaphony. Sometimes they were in sync, other times they seemed
to be playing entirely different songs. It was unpleasant at best.

We only lasted a few songs. Before we fled, though I couldn't help but notice
the audience. The music may have been painful, but unlike most gigs, the crowd
were quiet and intent. Many seemed to be musicians themselves. I couldn't help
but think we were missing something.

...or maybe not. Still, two out of three ain't bad. Next up, Justin Bieber?
