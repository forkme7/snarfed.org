Vacation!

It's been a while since I've taken a trip, and there's no time like the
present, so I'm heading out on vacation.
[Jeremy](http://www.facebook.com/cotter) and I are going to the continent for
a couple weeks. We'll be in Paris, Barcelona, and the south of France.

I've never been to either country, so I'm excited. We'll definitely hit all
the tourist sightseeing standards, but Jeremy has friends and family in
France, so I'm also looking forward to spending time with locals. And yes, for
all you foodies out there, we'll definitely come back with a few

[stories](http://www.amateurgourmet.com/2009/08/dinner_at_el_bu.html).

I'll be back Tues 10/28. See you then!
