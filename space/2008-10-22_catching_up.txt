Catching up

I've been lazy about posting recently, so I haven't mentioned lots of fun
stuff that we've done. Here's a recap, most recent first:

[Vanessa](http://vanessaart.com/) and Nuri and I went to see
[Aubrey de Grey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey)
[speak about life extension research](http://stantrans.blogspot.com/2008/10/talk-by-dr-aubrey-de-grey.html)
at Stanford. Very, very cool. He does basic research and runs a
[foundation](http://www.methuselahfoundation.org/), but also
enjoys the controversy around his ideas and parlays it into funding.
Regardless, he's crazy smart, crazy energetic, and has no filter whatsoever, so
he's an awesome speaker.

Last weekend, we went to see [ACT](http://act-sf.org/)'s production of
[Tom Stoppard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Stoppard)'s
new play [Rock 'n Roll](http://www.act-sf.org/089/rocknroll/). I hadn't
been to a play in a long time, but I really enjoyed this one. It was largely
a vehicle for politics and philosophy, but it was
still entertaining, thought provoking, and very very polished. It's also
[critically acclaimed](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/19/DDVQ12T4KE.DTL&hw=stoppard&sn=001&sc=1000),
which never hurts. Thanks to
[Nick](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/7/924/2aa) for organizing!

The new [SF Symphony](http://sfsymphony.org/) season finally started!
[Strauss headlined](http://sfsymphony.org/music/ProgramNotes.aspx?id=33810) the
[first performance](http://sfsymphony.org/season/Event.aspx?eventid=33280)
I went to. Emanuel Ax played piano, and Peter Oundjian conducted. I was
particularly surprised by the
[Tchaikovsky](http://sfsymphony.org/music/ProgramNotes.aspx?id=33812)
piece, which was striking. I had no idea he'd done any tone poems!

A bunch of us went to see [Chris Babson](Chris_Babson_-_Perfectly)'s
new band [NIAYH](http://www.myspace.com/NIAYHband) play at the
[Hotel Utah](http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&q=%22hotel+utah%22+near+94105&fb=1&view=text&latlng=9865554046365457198&dtab=0&ei=ptH-SJ2BIIn8iwOn3-SLDw&oi=&sa=X)
a few weeks ago. They may have an awkward name, but they're great musicians and
some of the nicest, sweetest guys you'll ever meet. They were also on the last
legs of a grueling cross-country tour, so they were looking forward to going
home. Happy trails...

[Ken and Tina got married](http://kenandtina08.com/)! This one is big
enough that it deserves a post of its own, and it'll probably get one,
eventually. Until then, you'll have to be satisfied with a

[Orkut](http://www.stanford.edu/~orkut/), Derek, and
[Marissa](http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#marissa) invited us to
the [SF Symphony Opening Gala](http://sfsymphony.org/season/default.aspx?id=32872).
It was the first time I'd been, and it was much more of a socialite event
than the normal performances, but it was still a lot of fun. And the
outfits! OK, us guys were boring in tuxes, but the gowns were stunning. The
[Chronicle's society page](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=/c/a/2008/09/04/BA9C12O21K.DTL&o=)
agreed.

Finally, I've had a lot of fun with short, sweet, downloadable
indie games recently: [World of Goo](http://www.worldofgoo.com/),
[Braid](http://braid-game.com/),
[PixelJunk Eden](http://pixeljunk.jp/library/Eden/), and
[Echochrome](http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3/Games/echochrome), among
others. World of Goo and Braid, in particular, are highly recommended. So
fun, and such memorable experiences!
