Snipscrape is a screen scraper for [SnipSnap](http://snipsnap.org/). It enables
you to import pages from one SnipSnap site into another, or to recover content
from SnipSnap-generated HTML pages. It does this by transforming HTML pages
generated by SnipSnap into XML that can be imported.

Snipscrape is implemented in XSLT, and comes with a shell script for \*nix
platforms that does some useful preprocessing. You can use snipscrape without
the shell script, but you'll need to perform a few tasks by hand, such as
escaping special characters.

Assuming you'd like to scrape two pages, snip1.html and snip2.html, here's what
you'd do:

    $ snipscrape.sh snip1.html snip2.html > snips.xml

Now, go to the manager page in your SnipSnap, import snips.xml, and you should
be set!
