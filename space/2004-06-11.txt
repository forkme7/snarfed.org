### Faisan, Class of 2000 ![/space/faisan_thumb.jpg](/space/faisan_thumb.jpg)

Yesterday I took off from work a little early, drove up to Palo Alto, and went
to a reunion for the class of 2000. This wasn't a high school or college
reunion, though. No, it was a [dorm reunion](/gallery/Faisan+Reunion+2004).

**Update**: I dug up a few pictures. [Secret Snowflake,
anyone?](/gallery/Faisan+Reunion+2004#post).
