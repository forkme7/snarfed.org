I Heart My (Damaged Goods) Car

Not only is it easy to be bitter about Valentine's Day, it's also fashionable
and hip. You know the drill. First the "hallmark holiday" refrain, then the
singles party invitations, and finally the litany of complaints from neglected
girlfriends. (OK, and the occasional boyfriend.)

I don't buy it. Call me old-fashioned, but I love Valentine's day. It's one of
my favorite holidays. I've been on both the giving and receiving ends of some
amazing gifts. Whether or not I'm dating someone, though, it's always a boatload
of fun.

This year was no exception, but I also got a present I wasn't quite expecting.
Evidently, someone had a crush on my car and took it a little too literally. I
left my office to find it looking like this. Worse, its secret admirer was shy,
and didn't leave a note!

Luckily, everything worked out in the end. The damage is only cosmetic, and they
left a note, it just blew away. Still, like all good Valentine's Day presents, I
expect this will be a one-time thing. I don't think my car could take much more
tough love.
