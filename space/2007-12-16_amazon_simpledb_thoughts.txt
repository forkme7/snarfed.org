[Amazon](http://amazon.com/) recently announced their latest web service,
[SimpleDB](http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb), to a roar of
[buzz](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/14/amazon-takes-on-oracle-and-ibm-with-simple-db-beta/)

and
[like with the Facebook Data Store API](/space/facebook+data+store+api+thoughts),

The executive summary is: I like it. It's solid, straightforward, and
eminently useful. Sure, it's limited. It includes design decisions that
clearly simplified the implementation at the cost of functionality and
usability. Still, as a result of those decisions, SimpleDB has
the potential to be very robust, scalable, and performant.

With SimpleDB alongside [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3) and
[EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2), Amazon's web services look more and more
like the [Unix philosophy](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/): small,
simple tools that do one job, do it well, and fit together in ways that
complement each other. Very, very cool.
