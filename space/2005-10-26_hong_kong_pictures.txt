I've finally posted [pictures from Hong Kong](hong_kong_2005).

I have lots of scribbled notes from the trip, so I could easily post a big long
travelog-style writeup. I doubt anyone besides my close friends and family would
read it, though, and I've already told them all about the trip.

So, I'll just let the [pictures](hong_kong_2005) speak for themselves!
