Senior Formal

Senior Formal 2003 was held at _fabulous_ San Francisco City Hall. (No really,
it was fabulous. Incredibly, over-the-top,
don't-be-fooled-by-the-rocks-that-i-got fabulous. I have no idea why they let a
bunch of drunk college kids crash it.)

Right now, this is just Ryan and Suz. Maulik (and others), if you have pictures,
feel free to add them!
