Shell app for App Engine's High Reliability Datastore

I've had less to say here about [App Engine](http://appengine.google.com/) since
I [moved to a new team last year](2010-03-13_new_job). The team has still been
[cranking](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/roadmap.html), though, both
behind the scenes and with new features like [namespaces](), [channels](),
[prospective search](), [always on]() and [instances](), and - near and dear to
my heart - the
[High Replication Datastore](http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2011/01/announcing-high-replication-datastore.html).

The HRD behaves differently from the original master/slave datastore in a number
of ways. The
[documentation](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/hr/)
describes them admirably, especially considering how subtle the edge cases in
Paxos can be.

Still, sometimes there's no substitute for real, live, running code. That's why
I've set up a new instance of the
[venerable](2008-04-07_google_app_engine_launched)
[shell app](http://shell.appspot.com/) that uses the HRD:
[shell-hrd.appspot.com](http://shell-hrd.appspot.com/). I've already used it
myself to check something: [eventually consistent reads]() aren't supported
inside transactions on HRD, just like on M/S.

As usual, App Engine's self service and rapid deployment made this a joy. I'd
already written the code, so I just created the new app in the
[admin console](http://appengine.google.com/) - taking care to select the HRD
option - updated the app id in `app.yaml`, added a note to the front page, and
ran `appcfg.py update`....and it was up and serving. Immediate gratification in
under two minutes.

Enjoy!
