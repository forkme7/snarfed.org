synchronizing GNU screen's paste buffer and the X selection

I
hate the mouse. It's good for some things, but not my work. Switching between
the mouse and the keyboard wreaks havoc on my muscle memory and fine-motor flow.
Thanks to [Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/),
[Ion](http://iki.fi/tuomov/ion), [Pine](http://www.washington.edu/pine/),
[Gaim](http://gaim.sf.net), and [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com) (God bless
[Find As You Type](http://www.mozilla.org/access/type-ahead/)), I can do
everything I need to with the keyboard. The only thing I _can't_ do with the
keyboard is copy text from a terminal. And that irks me.

In the past, this has driven me to desperate measures, including [running shells
inside Emacs](/space/why I don). I currently use [GNU
screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)'s [copy/scrollback
mode](http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/screen/screen_73.html), with a hack to
integrate it with X Windows' clipboard.

This command in [my .screenrc](http://ryan.barrett.name/dotfiles/.screenrc)
copies screen's paste buffer into the X primary selection. It runs automatically
when you press > to set the second mark in copy/scrollback mode.


    \# set the second mark, write to the screen-exchange






      1. file, and use xsel to synchronize the paste buffer



      2. with the X selection.





    bindkey -m > eval "stuff ' '" writebuf "exec sh -c 'xsel -n <
/tmp/screen-exchange'"

Note that this uses [Conrad Parker's
xsel](http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/) (_not_[ Ville Herva's
xsel](http://www.niksula.cs.hut.fi/~vherva/xsel/)), which needs to be somewhere
in your PATH.
