[![GDC 2007](/space/gdc2007.jpg)](/space/GDC 2007)

This was my sixth year at [GDC](http://gdconf.com/), and as always, it's a lot
of fun to take a break for a bit and immerse myself in an entirely different
world.

Like the [last](/space/GDC 2005) [two](/space/GDC 2006) years, I've written up
[my thoughts on GDC 2007](/space/GDC 2007). Enjoy!
