GDC 2008
[!![GDC 2008](/space/gdc_2008_logo.jpg)](http://gdconf.com/)

I'm back from [GDC](http://gdconf.com/). As always, it was inspiring, thought
provoking, and lots of fun. I wrote up my thoughts the [last](/space/GDC+2005)
[few](/space/GDC+2006) [years](/space/GDC+2007), and I've [written them up this
year too](/space/GDC+2008).
