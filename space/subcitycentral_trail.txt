**The Trail**

  * [**SEN5241**](http://sen5241.net/) **_(Trailhead)_**

The "subjecte" detained by OMM after "several violations of community and omm
laws." Currently in "hold status," due for release on August 14. Other links:

[http://sen5241.net/sccinfo.html](http://sen5241.net/sccinfo.html)

Information about the "Subcitycentral State." Gives the Subcitycentral office
phone number (?), 581-814.

[http://sen5241.net/filestore.html](http://sen5241.net/filestore.html)

Sen5241's file storage. Currently shows an error:

> _SUBJECTE 5241 DOES NOT HAVE FILE ATTRIBUTES_

Gives another phone number (?) to call for assistance; 573-239.

[http://sen5241.net/subinfo.html](http://sen5241.net/subinfo.html)

Subjecte information for Sen. Currently says,

> SUBJECTE 5241 INFORMATION NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL RELEASE FROM DETENTION.

Has the same phone number as the file storage page.

[http://sen5241.net/percom.html](http://sen5241.net/percom.html)

Sen's personal log. Currently says,

> SUBJECTE 5241 PERSONAL LOG NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL RELEASE FROM DETENTION

Has the same phone number as the file storage page.

[http://sen5241.net/omminter.html](http://sen5241.net/omminter.html)

A ghostly head directs you to _MAKE YOUR STATEMENT TO OMM THEN PRESS REPLY_.
(The title of the page is 211345 - another phone number?) Pressing the Reply but
ton takes you to...

[http://sen5241.net/ommsession.html](http://sen5241.net/ommsession.html)

Same as above, except with a link to [omm.js](http://sen5241.net/omm.js), which
is the same as [sscsubjecte.js](http://sen5241.net/sscsubjecte.js), except with
a new person's name:

> OMM STANDARD RESPONSE LOG: BY ETG-7690

Empty page. The source contains this tag and comment:

Note the lower-case letters; they spell out:

> read on i need help sen

The page is titled "Non-Omm Generated Information."

Finally, the site has a custom 404 page. If you go to a nonexistent page (e.g.
[http://sen5241.net/asdf](http://sen5241.net/asdf)), it tells you that you don't
have "authority" to access the page. However, if you go to a _directory_ (e.g.
[http://www.sen5241.net/audio/](http://www.sen5241.net/audio/)), it has a
different page. It says _THIS AREA IS NOT AVAILABLE_, but more importantly, it
has another phone number, 563884.

  * [http://TRI9842.net/](http://TRI9842.net/)

Web design (and audio?) house that wrote the script that plays the sounds on
[http://sen5241.net/](http://sen5241.net/) . Strangely, the script points to
[http://tri9842.net/](http://tri9842.net/) , which doesn't exist. The domain
itself isn't even registered...maybe this name will be useful later? The script
itself is [http://sen5241.net/sscsubjecte.js](http://sen5241.net/sscsubjecte.js)
. The script also contains an obscure 17-digit string: **768U-983IJ7-25RE-RYG**.
The string's format is similar to GUIDs (globally unique identifiers) used in
Windows.

  * [StateWellness](http://statewellness.net/)

Currently empty. Just a picture of a bottle of pills (red, blue, white, yellow)
and:

> STATEWELLNESS.NET UPDATING FOR NEXT SERIES

One interesting thing...at the end of the page, there's some malformed HTML:

    </td></tr?
    ></table>
    </body>
    </html>

The error is just big enough that it might not be a typo...but what could it
mean?

  * [**Subcity Central**](http://subcitycentral.net/)

Similar to statewellness.net. Has the same quote and a picture of a police
officer with a baton (?). Also has the same malformed html, but this doesn't
confirm that it's meaningful, since page source was just copy-and-pasted.
