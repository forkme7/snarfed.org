[SnipSnap](http://snipsnap.org/), the server that used to run this site,
supports [themes](http://snipsnap.org/space/Themes). They change your
SnipSnap-based site's appearance, using [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/),
images, and other files, without changing its content. There's a
[tutorial](http://snipsnap.org/space/Theme+Tutorial) on
[snipsnap.org](http://snipsnap.org/).

The snarfed.org theme is [available for download](/space/snarfed_theme.snip).
To try it out on your site,
[download snarfed_theme.snip](/space/snarfed_theme.snip), go to your
SnipSnap's setup page, import it, and set it as your theme. Voila!
