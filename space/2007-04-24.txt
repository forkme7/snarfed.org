I caught the [MC Frontalot](http://frontalot.com/) show at
[Cafe du Nord](http://www.cafedunord.com/) yesterday, in San Francisco,
accompanied by (the lovely) Becca and (the incomparable) John. The show was
one of the last stops on the
[Secrets of the Future tour](http://www.optimusrhyme.com/images/tour.jpg),
named after Front's new album.

Front was great, as always, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the rest
of the lineup. [K.Flay](http://kflay.com/) opened, looking for all the world like
the girl next door: nice, friendly, casual, and _very_ white. When [her
DJ](http://kflay.com/Photos/CoHo%20DJ.htm) dropped the beat, though, she threw
down rhymes like nobody's business. It was unnerving, to say the least. What's
more, she was damn good. She also reps my [alma mater](http://stanford.edu/),
which doesn't hurt.

[Optimus Rhyme](http://optimusrhyme.com/) was next, and they rocked the house.
I'd seen them before, at [PAX](http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/), and they were
in fine form on Sunday. The band came together as a group really well, the
music was seamless, and their frontman, Wheelie, must have been hopped up on
something really potent. His delivery was electric - half Zach de la Rocha,
half Killers, all nerdcore.


[MC Lars](http://mclars.com/) was the second headliner on the tour, along with
Front. He comes from Stanford, like K.Flay, and shares her penchant for
combining literary references with both highbrow and lowbrow humor. He played
with a full band, though, and like Optimus Rhyme, it rocked. In particular, I loved
his homages to two Bay Area music genres, [Hot Topic is Not Punk
Rock](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2378537142833294049) and [White
Kids Aren't
Hyphy](http://live105.imeem.com/video/iL7NqyDo/mc_lars_white_kids_arent_hyphy_live_cafe_du_nord_live105com/).

Too much fun. I'm off to buy
[Front's new CD](http://frontalot.com/index.php/?page=store).
