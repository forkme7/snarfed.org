### Web geek stuff

Warning: unless you like silly technical web stuff, stop reading now. :P

I've added a few little features to [SnipSnap](/space/SnipSnap), the program
that powers snarfed.org. Here are the writeups for each feature:

[http://snipsnap.org/space/javascript](http://snipsnap.org/space/javascript)
[http://snipsnap.org/space/virtual+host+redirection](http://snipsnap.org/space/virtual+host+redirection)
[http://snipsnap.org/space/register+without+email](http://snipsnap.org/space/register+without+email)

Also, check out a really interesting one [maulik](/space/maulik) wrote:

[http://www.snipsnap.org/space/restricted+access+2](http://www.snipsnap.org/space/restricted+access+2)

Of course, if you've looked at the [pictures](/space/pictures), you're already
familiar with the [album](/space/album) macro we wrote.
