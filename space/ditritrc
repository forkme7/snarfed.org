# Configuration file for ditrit.
# http://snarfed.org/space/ditrit
# Copyright 2006 Ryan Barrett <ditrit@ryanb.org>
#
# This is an example ditrit config file. Each line consists of two parts, a
# template regexp and a command. When ditrit runs, it matches the input against
# each template, in order. When it finds a template that matches, it runs that
# template's command.
#
# The command is expanded against the template regexp's match data. \1 through
# \9 are expanded with the individual match groups in the template regexp.
# \g<0> is expanded to the entire template match.
#
# Templates are surrounded with two delimiter characters. By convention,
# delimiters are quotes, as below. However, they may be any character that does
# not appear in the template itself.
#
# Lines starting with # are ignored, as are whitespace-only lines.

# email addresses. writing an email address regexp that's fully RFC822
# compliant is kinda impossible. this is close and not too overkill. if you
# really want an RFC822 regexp, try
