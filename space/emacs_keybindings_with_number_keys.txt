emacs keybindings with number keys

I
use [GNU Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/), and I love it. However, I had
trouble recently when I tried to re-bind C-1 to do something new.

Executive summary? Do this:

    (global-set-key [(control \1)] 'foo)

Note the escaped 1. Evidently this keystroke syntax interprets numeric arguments
as key ids, or something, instead of the key's actual character. So, to make it
interpret the key binding the way we want, we have to escape the 1.

Note that there's another keystroke syntax, too:

    (global-set-key "C-1" 'foo)

I don't know how to get this to work with number keys...but the first way is
good enough for me.
