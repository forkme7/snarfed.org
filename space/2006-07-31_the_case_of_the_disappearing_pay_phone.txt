The Case of the Disappearing Pay Phone

<img class="right" src="pay_phone.jpg" />

I don't have a cell phone. Almost everyone else has one, so most people do a
double take when they first learn that I don't. I don't have a particularly good
reason, and it's definitely inconvenient, both for me and my friends and family.

Still, I don't have a cell phone. It's not even that I'm a [privacy
freak](privacy_through_prepaid_credit_cards); there are plenty of
[anonymous](http://www.vanishnow.com/cell.php) and
[prepaid](http://www.google.com/search?q=prepaid+cell+phone) cell phone plans
that would satisfy me. I just don't want one at all.

I have a landline in my apartment, of course, and a phone at work. I spend a
fair amount of time away from both, though.

When I'm with my friends, they grumble, but they'll lend me their cell phones.
If I'm on my own, though, I use pay phones. I probably use a pay phone three or
four times a week. I used to say that I'd get a cell phone when I saw pay phones
start to disappear, but sadly, that happened a long time ago. Given that, [this
AP article](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20060727/D8J4F06O7.html) made me
very, very scared.

Drivers' licenses, credit cards, and internet connectivity are all more or less
required to live a normal life in the 21st century. It's insidious, but it's a
fact of life. Cell phones are probably the next addition to that list. Sigh...
