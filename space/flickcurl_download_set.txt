flickcurl_download_set.sh

<img class="right" src="flickr.jpg" />

[flickcurl](http://librdf.org/flickcurl/), a command line utility for
interacting with [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/), is awesome. I use it to
download friends' photos. Here's a bash script I use to automate the process of
downloading all of the photos in a set:

    #!/bin/bash
    ids=`flickcurl -q photosets.getPhotos "$@" |& \
           grep -E -o 'ID [0-9]+' | cut -c4-`
    for id in ids; do
      wget `flickcurl -q photos.getSizes $id |& \
              grep -E -o 'http://.+_o.jpg'`
    done

Save this as `flickcurl_download_set.sh`. Get the id of the photo set you want
to download. (Hint: it's the last number in the photo set URL, e.g. 
<code>http://www.flickr.com/photos/user/sets/<strong>12345678901234</strong>/</code>.)
Then pass the photo set id to this script:

    $ ./flickcurl_download_set.sh 12345678901234

If you want to download a private photo set, just
[authenticate your Yahoo account with flickcurl](http://librdf.org/flickcurl/api/flickcurl-auth-authenticate.html)
first.
