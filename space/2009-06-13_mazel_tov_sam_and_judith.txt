I spent last weekend at rustic
[Camp Tamarack](http://www.tamarackcamps.com/Rentals/CampMaas.aspx),
outside of Detroit, for
[Sam Glassenberg's and Judith Horwitz's wedding](http://judithandsam.blogspot.com/).
Mazel tov to the
[happy couple](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=89742009100)!

I haven't known Judith for long, but Sam has been a friend of mine for over a
decade. I couldn't have been happier to celebrate with them and our mutual
friends over the long wekeend. Plus, I'd been to Jewish weddings before,
complete with [chuppah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuppah) and
[ketubah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketubah), but none were quite as involved
or featuring as many of the traditional ceremonies as this one. I learned a lot,
and even got to serve as a witness, which was an honor.

The camp itself was gorgeous. Apart from the wedding activities themselves, one
of my favorite parts of the weekend was running through the grounds. The lake,
woods, and fields were pastoral, quiet, interrupted only by reminders of
children's summer camp. Cabins, boat docks, ropes courses, and even the
requisite barn, complete with hay loft. So cute!

Most importantly, we were happy to celebrate Sam and Judith's new life together
with so many friends and family. The

definitely show it. Mazel tov!
