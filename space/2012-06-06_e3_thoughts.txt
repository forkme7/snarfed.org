[E3](http://www.e3expo.com/) is here! I love games, and E3 and GDC always give
me a good excuse to Monday morning quarterback and second guess the platform
holders, major publishers, and quirky indie developers. There's more than enough
real press coverage from [actual](http://edge-online.com/)
[game](http://penny-arcade.com/report/)
[journalists](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/), so I'll stick to just shooting my
mouth off [like](2009-06-01_e3) [always](e3_2006). Here we go!

Overall, the big news this year was that there's no big news.
[Microsoft](http://www.edge-online.com/features/e3-2012-microsoft-press-conference-report)
and [Sony](http://www.edge-online.com/news/e3-2012-sony-press-conference-report)
[aren't ready to announce](http://www.edge-online.com/opinion/e3-2012-blame-next-gen-lacklustre-conferences)
their new consoles yet, and all of the top tier first and second party
developers are working on next gen titles, so they phoned it in. Nintendo
[revealed more of the Wii U](http://www.edge-online.com/features/e3-2012-nintendo-conference-report),
including games and online social features like
[Miiverse](http://www.edge-online.com/news/e3-2012-nintendo-unveils-wii-u-miiverse-network),
but most people remain skeptical. They've proven us wrong before, with the DS
and Wii, but they've also proven us right with stillborn efforts like Friend
Codes and eShop, so who knows.

More importantly, the game industry is changing, and E3 may just not be a priority
for the new players in social, mobile, and web. At its core, E3 is a trade show
that brings hardware makers, game publishers, and big box retailers together to
bang out space on store shelves for the upcoming year. That doesn't matter to
Apple, Google, Facebook, or many of the other companies defining the new world
order of gaming, and it shows.

The old vanguard see the writing on the wall, of course. GameStop is still
[milking used games](http://www.joystiq.com/2009/01/23/gamestop-used-games-revenue-estimated-to-be-2-billion/)
for all they're worth, but it also
[bought digital download platform Impulse](http://news.gamestop.com/press-release/business/gamestop-announces-acquisition-spawn-labs-and-agreement-acquire-impulse-inc)
years ago. More recently, Microsoft and Sony have fallen over themselves in
their haste to integrate with social networks. This year, they both
[announced](http://www.edge-online.com/news/e3-2012-microsoft-announces-smartglass)
[integration](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/4/3064401/sony-renames-playstation-suite-to-playstation-mobile-htc-is-first)
with iOS and Android. (Yes, you read that right.)

Microsoft's
[Smart Glass transmedia platform](http://www.edge-online.com/news/e3-2012-microsoft-announces-smartglass)
is interesting, to be sure, but it was
[just as interesting back in 2006](e3_2006#live_anywhere) when it was called
[Live Anywhere](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002983720_ethree10.html),
and that ended up dead and nowhere. So, again, who knows.

The consensus was that if anyone "won" E3, it was actually Ubisoft with
their breathtaking
_[Watch Dogs](http://www.edge-online.com/news/e3-2012-ubisoft-announces-watch-dogs)_
demo and other solid titles. When a third party publisher has the biggest press
conference of the show, you know it's a slow year.

Otherwise, it was the same predictable parade of AAA games and incremental
hardware improvements,
[Wonderbook notwithstanding](http://www.edge-online.com/news/e3-2012-sony-announces-wonderbook).
Sony
[didn't even try to breathe life into Vita](http://www.edge-online.com/news/e3-2012-sony-admits-vita-neglect),
and Nintendo's
[afterthought 3DS press junket](http://e3.nintendo.com/videos/#/Software-Showcase-at-E3-2012)
wasn't much more convincing.

Personally, my favorite part of the show so far is
_[Unfinished Swan](http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/the-unfinished-swan-is-a-tragedy-that-uses-archtecture-and-level-design-to)_,
a thought provoking, jarringly beautiful gem exclusive to PSN. Sony may be
clumsy, but I'll commend them for their
[long-running support](http://www.edge-online.com/news/sony-industry-must-support-indie-developers)
of wonderful, artistic indie games that really advance the medium, via
[Pub Fund](http://www.joystiq.com/2011/07/13/sony-invests-20-million-into-pub-fund-over-the-next-three-years/)
and
[Minis](http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2011/07/icon_games_discusses_joy_of_playstation_minis_development)
and all the way back to
[Net Yaroze](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/169245/15_years_later_how_sonys_net_.php).
It's no wonder more and more indies are jumping ship to PSN from the
[ham-fisted XBLA](http://gamer.blorge.com/2011/08/24/indie-devs-sick-of-xboxs-heavy-handed-policies-sony-pub-fund-the-answer/)
and
[ghetto of XBLIG](http://www.edge-online.com/news/cthulhu-dev-its-no-wonder-xbox-indie-games-sell-poorly),
if they don't jump all the way to iOS, Android, or Facebook.

In any case, check out the _Unfinished Swan_
[trailer](http://www.gamespot.com/the-unfinished-swan/videos/teaser-trailer-the-unfinished-swan-6374686/)
and
[interview](http://www.gamespot.com/the-unfinished-swan/videos/painting-curiosity-unfinished-swan-interview-with-ian-dallas-6374898/).
It may just be my game of show, what with _Last Guardian_ in
[development hell](http://www.edge-online.com/news/e3-2012-technical-difficulties-holding-last-guardian)
 and
_Beyond Good & Evil 2_
[pushed out to next gen](http://www.shacknews.com/article/73741/beyond-good-evil-2-in-active-creation).

See you next year!
