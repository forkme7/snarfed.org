Last weekend,
[Orkut](http://homepage.mac.com/orkutb/WhiteParty/large-137.html),
[Clayton](http://homepage.mac.com/orkutb/WhiteParty/large-157.html), and
[Derek](http://homepage.mac.com/orkutb/PhotoBooth/large-152.html)
said goodbye to their Soma loft in style.
[White Party](http://homepage.mac.com/orkutb/WhiteParty/) was some of the most
fun I've had in a while. Everyone really got into the theme.
Along with the

[costumes](http://homepage.mac.com/orkutb/WhiteParty/large-37.html),
there were
[gorgeous decorations](http://homepage.mac.com/orkutb/WhiteParty/large-19.html),
an
[ice luge](http://homepage.mac.com/orkutb/WhiteParty/large-12.html),
a
[photo booth](http://homepage.mac.com/orkutb/WhiteParty/large-164.html),
and of course, the world famous Studio 767
[go-go dancers](http://homepage.mac.com/orkutb/WhiteParty/large-7.html).
