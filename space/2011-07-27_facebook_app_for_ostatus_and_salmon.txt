Facebook app for OStatus and Salmon

These days, social networks are sprouting like weeds. I don't know about you,
but I groan a bit every time I get a burst of invitations from the latest
network du jour. I usually ignore them, but I know I'm missing out on a few good
conversations and early adopter friends. I've always wanted to have just one
profile and friend list, in one place, and use that to connect to people on any
other social network. Email already does this; why can't the rest?

The short answer is, they can. The [OStatus]() federation protocol is the
leading mechanism right now. It hasn't been adopted by any of the majors yet,
but similar to [OpenID](http://openid.net/) and [OAuth](http://oauth.net/), I
expect many will, gradually, over time.

Some won't, though. [Facebook](http://facebook.com/)'s track record with open
standards and data

[at](http://opencompute.org/)
[best](http://developers.facebook.com/opensource/),
and their reputation there isn't much better. However, their
[API](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) is comprehensive enough
that third party apps could easily implement bridges themselves.
