About a month ago,
[Sep Kamvar](http://www.wefeelfine.org/creators.html#sepandar)
wandered into my office. He was curious about the
[art on the walls](http://vanessaart.com/), which I'd
stolen fair and square from
[my sister](http://vanessaart.com/).
I gave him her card, went back to work, and promptly forgot about the encounter...

...until Vanessa announced her next show, a collaboration with Sep's
independent clothing line, [Distilled Spirit](http://distilledspirit.com/).
He's always on the lookout for local artists to work with, and Vanessa was
happy to oblige. Cool!

I spread the word, and promised the
[friday dinner](/space/friday_mexican_dinner) crew
a real, honest-to-God taqueria in the Mission if they came to the show. We
grabbed dinner at
[Taqueria San Francisco](http://www.burritophile.com/place.php?id=73),
which had damn good burritos, even though they were out of their signature
dish, [buche](http://www.burritoblog.com/2006/04/buche_yummy_pig.html).

Undeterred, I led the way down the street to [Warehouse
1310](http://warehouse1310.com/), where the show was already in full swing. Sep
and crew did an admirable job of making a raw, empty warehouse look edgy and
cool with just a few touches here and there. Vanessa's art looked great, and
the clothes and other art did too.
