About a month ago,
[Sep Kamvar](http://www.wefeelfine.org/creators.html#sepandar)
wandered into my office. He was curious about the
[art on the walls](http://vanessaart.com/), which I
stole fair and square from
[my sister](http://vanessaart.com/).
I gave him her card, went back to work, and promptly forgot about the encounter...

...until a couple weeks ago, when Vanessa announced her next show, a
collaboration with [Distilled Spirit](http://distilledspirit.com/), an
independent clothing line that Sep co-founded. He's always on the lookout for
local artists to work with, and Vanessa was happy to oblige. Cool!

I spread the word, and promised the
[friday dinner crew](/space/friday+mexican+dinner)
a real, honest-to-God Mission taqueria if they came to the
show. We grabbed dinner at
[Taqueria San Francisco](http://www.burritophile.com/place.php?id=73),
which did have damn good burritos, even if 
they were out of their signature dish,
[buche](http://www.burritoblog.com/2006/04/buche_yummy_pig.html).

Undeterred, I led the way down the street to
[Warehouse 1310](http://warehouse1310.com/),
where the show was already in full swing. Sep and crew did an admirable job of
making a raw, empty warehouse look edgy and cool with just a few touches.
Vanessa's art looked great, and the clothes and other art did too.
