[Referrer
spam](http://www.spywareinfo.com/articles/referer_spam/) - or by Apache's
original misspelling, _referer_ spam - has been a problem at snarfed.org for
years. My webalizer logs were publicly
accessibl at one point, so spammers targeted this site with fake referrers, hoping that
they'll be linked from the pages that
[webalizer](http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/) generates.

There are a number of approaches to fighting referrer spam, but so far, no
silver bullet. I currently handle it a hand-edited blacklist of known spammer's
sites. It's far from ideal, but it works. You can find my blacklist in my
[webalizer.conf](/space/webalizer.conf) file. If you're
fighting referrer spam too, feel free to borrow it.

Eventually, I'd like to merge this with other blacklists and referrer spam
tools, such as [Jay Allen's](http://www.jayallen.org/)
[MT-Blacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/). For now, though, one step
at a time.
