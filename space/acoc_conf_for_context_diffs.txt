acoc.conf for context diffs

For the impatient:  
[.acoc.conf](acoc.conf) for coloring context diffs  
[Patch](acoc-diff-context.patch) for acoc 0.7.1  

[Acoc](http://www.caliban.org/ruby/acoc.shtml) is one of my favorite \*nix tools.
It adds color to common commands like ls, diff, grep, make, and top. This
drastically [improves their
usability](http://www.colormatters.com/usability.html). It's also extensible, so
it's easy to color new programs and change colors for existing programs.

For example, acoc 0.7.1 includes rules for coloring [unified format
diffs](http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Unified-Format.html).
However, it doesn't have a rule for "changed" lines, which start with ! and are
unique to [context format
diffs](http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Context-Format.html#Context%20Format).
To color those lines, add this to your _~/.acoc.conf_:

    [diff,rcsdiff/t,cvs diff/t,p4 diff/t]
    /^([!*].*)/        yellow

[This patch](acoc-diff-context.patch) adds the
rule to acoc 0.7.1.
