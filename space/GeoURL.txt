GeoURL

[GeoUrl](http://geourl.org/)
is a nifty site that maps web sites to geographical locations, similar to
[geocoding](/space/geocoding). It also maintains this index in reverse, which
you can use to find sites located near other sites in the real world.

To connect your web page to GeoUrl, [follow their
instructions](http://geourl.org/add.html) to find your coordinates and add an
ICBM header to your page. Then, [ping GeoUrl](http://geourl.org/ping/) with your
site. Finally, add a link to other sites near your own, like so:

[http://geourl.org/near/?p=http://snarfed.org/](http://geourl.org/near/?p=http://snarfed.org/)

The [buttons](/space/buttons) page has a convenient GeoUrl icon:
