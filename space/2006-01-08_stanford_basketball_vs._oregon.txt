This was a great weekend. Among other things, I went to a [Stanford basketball
game](http://gostanford.collegesports.com/sports/m-baskbl/recaps/010706aaa.html)
at Maples on Saturday. We played [Oregon](http://goducks.com/) in what the AP
sportswriters described as
["wild"](http://gostanford.collegesports.com/sports/m-baskbl/recaps/010706aaa.html)
and ["a
heartbreaker,"](http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=500&ATCLID=223914)
depending on which side you were on.

It was both of those and more...except for the first half. We jumped ahead
early, and controlled the game enough to finish the first half with a solid, if
boring, 8-point lead.

The second half was way more exciting. Oregon bounced between 10 and 2 points
down, and both teams played the game fast and loose. We saw thread-the-needle
layups, huge rejections, dumb turnovers, and even a half-court violation. The
refs were pretty fast and loose too, and made silly calls for both sides.

Oregon pushed hard in the last couple minutes, but we held our ground just long
enough to stay ahead by a field goal, 64-62. It was a ton of fun to watch, and
it must have been even more fun to play.

Apart from the game, I spent the weekend cooking, [eating dim
sum](http://www.222.to/joyluckplace/), [seeing the
symphony](http://www.sfsymphony.org/templates/event_info.asp?nodeid=250&callid=93&eventid=932),
partying in the city, hiking in the foothills, [learning emergency
medicine](http://www.stanfordhospital.com/), and catching up with family and
friends. And tomorrow I have _get_ to go to work!
