The second half of my set of [symphony](http://sfsymphony.org) tickets began
last night! We heard Debussy's _En Blanc et Noir_, Rimsky-Korsakov's
_Scheherezade_, and a contemporary piece by John Adams. _Schherezade_ is a great
performance piece, big and sweeping and dramatic. There are recognizable themes,
lots of different textures, and more than a few solos. It must be a lot of fun
to play. The contemporary piece was actually more interesting than I expected,
too, which was a nice surprise.

However, I was most excited about the Debussy. It was much simpler and more
minimal than the pieces he's known for, like _La Mer_ or _Afternoon of a Faun_.
However, it had some really interesting phrases. What's more, Debussy composed
it for two pianos, and this was an orchestration commissioned by the SFS. I'll
have to find a recording of the original for two pianos.
