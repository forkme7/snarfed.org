A few days ago, my article on [GMail vs. Pine](/space/gmail_vs_pine) was [posted
to Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/05/1936209). Soon after,
it was posted to [Digg](http://digg.com/software/Gmail_vs._Pine),
[Reddit](http://reddit.com/info/41sx/comments), and other geek news sites.

The torrent of traffic quickly brought my poor little server
[to](/space/slashdotted_referrers.html)
[its](/space/slashdotted_days.html)
[knees](/space/slashdotted_overview.html). I tried bringing it
back up, but the flood of visitors put it right back down again. I had no choice
but to wait until the story ran its course and fell off the Slashdot front page.
My [hosting company](http://jvds.com/) was not amused.

So, apologies for the outage. On the plus side, it generated a
[lot](http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=182257&threshold=-1&mode=thread&commentsort=0&op=Change)
[of](http://digg.com/software/Gmail_vs._Pine) [comments](/comments/gmail_vs_pine). Digg user [oltompic](http://digg.com/users/oltompic) posted my
[favorite](http://digg.com/software/Gmail_vs._Pine#c1399570):

Eloquent in its simplicity. I can only hope to achieve to such a Zen outlook on
life, liberty, and the pursuit of email nirvana.
