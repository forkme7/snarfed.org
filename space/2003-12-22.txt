A few minutes ago, I noticed a distinctly odd feeling. I was a little
disoriented, and I felt like the room was swimming, kind of how you feel when
you're nauseous, but I didn't feel nauseous. Even stranger, I could have sworn I
was swaying back and forth, almost imperceptibly, even though I knew I was
sitting still.

Then I looked up and saw the lamps swinging wildly around the room, and I
realized it was just [an
earthquake](http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/research/strongmotion/effects/shake/40148755/intensity.html).
No big deal, right?

...no big deal, that is, until I got an IM a few seconds later from a friend,
[Hal](http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume), down in Southern California. (I'm in Northern
California). He said they'd had an earthquake. Um, yow.

Turns out it was located about halfway between us, and was big. [6.5
big](http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/research/strongmotion/effects/shake/40148755/intensity.html),
to be exact.
