### Privacy and Credit Cards [![Icon-Permalink.png](/Icon-Permalink.png)](#)

If you've known me for any length of time, you know that I'm a privacy freak. I
can't explain why, but I'm hyper-sensitive about giving out personal
information. I practically hyperventilate when I consider all the databases of
things I've bought, people I've called, and movies I've watched. I may not be
especially private about my [desktop](/ryan.barrett.name/desktop.jpg) or
my personal life...but [I'll be damned if Safeway needs my phone number or
address](/space/privacy+through+prepaid+credit+cards) to sell me a loaf of bread.
