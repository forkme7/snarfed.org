### Purdy Pitchers

_Update: the psychedelia is fixed! Not that i don't like pinks and greens...but
they got a little icky after a while. Anyway, Sausalito and Graduation 2003 are
fine now._

So, the [pictures](/space/pictures) are back up. It took a while to get the
[album](/space/album) software and linux to play nice together, but they seem
happy now.

For the observant ones in the crowd, yes, we're aware of the bad-acid-trip
effect on [Sausalito](/gallery/Sausalito) and (in one) on [Graduation
2003](/gallery/Graduation 2003). We're working on it. Sheesh, don't you have
anything better to do?
