**Problem**

I recently played the game Beyond Good & Evil, and I [loved every
minute](2004-11-11_beyond_good_and_evil) of it. However, it has [a
bug](http://forums.ubi.com/eve/ubb.x?a=tpc&s=400102&f=401101532&m=286101532&r=396101532#396101532)
that prevents inverting the mouse input, in both "look" and "camera" modes.

I'm very used to inverting the mouse in games, so I looked for a fix. Anything
that can invert mouse input on the y axis, and works with
[DirectInput](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dninput/html/diov.asp)
would work. After a lot of work, including posts to many forums, and even a
[Google Answers
question](http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=408579), I found a few
solutions.

**Solutions**

[Moritz Franckenstein](http://www.maf-soft.de/) has written
a [shareware mouse driver](http://www.maf-soft.de/mafmouse/)
that inverts the y axis. Thanks, Moritz!

Otherwise, if you have Logitech MouseWare, and you're comfortable editing the
registry, try Ashley Ings'
[instructions](/comments/invert+mouse+in+Beyond+Good+%26+Evil#comment-invert%20mouse%20in%20Beyond%20Good%20&%20Evil-3),
originally posted [on the Logitech
forums](http://forums.logitech.com/pe/forums/displaypost.jsp?postID=10125316).
It works with both Logitech and non-Logitech mice.

**Background**

Before Moritz contacted me, I'd done a fair amount of research on this. When I
got to the point where I needed to write a Windows device driver, I called it
quits. That was a too much of a time investment, even for me. :P

I knew I needed either a setting or registry entry in Windows XP (or
[DirectX](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/default.aspx)) that controls
mouse orientation per-axis, or a program that runs in the background and inverts
the mouse input (per-axis).

I first looked through the windows mouse control panel, the registry, etc., and
didn't found anything.

I tried installing [Logitech's
MouseWare](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm?countryid=19&languageid=1&page=downloads/software&CRID=1793&contentid=6003)
and [Advanced Settings
Utility](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/downloads/software/US/EN,CRID=1793,contentid=6003,OSID=1,softwareid=6819),
which lets you change the mouse's orientation, and has effect in
DirectInput-based apps (close!), but doesn't let you change it per-axis. I also
tried [Kensington MouseWorks](http://www.kensington.com/html/1461.html), but I
don't have a Kensington mouse, so I couldn't use it.

I tried a number of utilities that let you drive the mouse pointer with a
joystick, and can control the orientation of each axis independently...but the
ones I tried don't have any effect when you use the mouse itself.

Finally, I wrote a
[script](invert_mouse.ahk) for
[AutoHotKey](http://autohotkey.com/), a pretty sophisticated program that lets
you script and remap mouse, keyboard, and joystick input. It inverts the mouse
per-axis successfully, but doesn't affect DirectInput apps.
