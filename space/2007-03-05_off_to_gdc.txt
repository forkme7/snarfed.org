Off to GDC

[![gdc](gdc.png)](http://gdconf.com/)

I'll be at [GDC](http://gdconf.com/), Game Developers Conference, next week. I
can't wait! This will be my sixth year, and I've written up the
[last](GDC_2005) [two](GDC_2006), so I'll probably write up this
one as well. If you'll be there, [drop me a line](about)!
