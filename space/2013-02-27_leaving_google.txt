Leaving Google

<img class="right shadow" src="riding_into_sunset.jpg" />

After almost ten great years at Google, I'm moving on. My last day is Friday.
I'll definitely miss it, but it's time for a new adventure!

Working at Google has been a hell of a ride. Other than internships and part
time work, this was my first job. I "grew up" in my career pretty much entirely
at Google, and I couldn't imagine a better place to do it. I worked on killer
projects, benefited from an awesome environment, and most importantly, worked
with and learned from amazing people. It's going to be a tough act to follow.

Even so, I'm looking forward to exploring new problems in a new environment. I'm
going to a startup with a few friends, but you already guessed that. We haven't
announced details yet, but I'll post here as soon as we do.

Google co-workers, don't get too comfortable, I'll still be sending you patches
and pull requests. Everyone else, wish me luck! See you on the other side...
