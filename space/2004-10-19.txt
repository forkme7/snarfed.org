It took us a while, but we finally packaged up [p4](/space/p4) and [released
it](http://freshmeat.net/projects/p4). Well, we've only released the backend and
a small example plugin and client; we haven't released the mp3 syncher yet. But
still, it's a release!

If you don't remember it from our senior year at school, [P4](/space/p4) is a
self-organizing, peer-to-peer overlay network similar to
[Gnutella](http://rfc-gnutella.sourceforge.net/) and
[Freenet](http://freenet.sf.net/). However, P4 differs in that it provides an
API for developing plugin applications on top of the network. P4 handles the
networking and exports functionality for unicast, multicast, user and plugin
discovery, and strong encryption and authentication. This frees developers from
worrying about networking, and allows them to focus on building real
functionality.
