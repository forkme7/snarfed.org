After [four years on App Engine](/space/2008-04-07_google_app_engine_launched),
I took a sabbatical and relaxed for the last couple months. I didn't go on an
extended trip or do anything big, but I did spend lots of time with friends and
family, worked on a few [side](/space/2010-04-12_dining_table_shopping)
[projects](/space/2010-03-28_working_on_my_car) and other fun things, and
generally forgot about work and made the most of the time off.

All good things must come to an end, though, so I finally went back to work on
Monday and started on a [new project](/space/2010-03-13_new_job). It's early
still, and I have a lot of domain knowledge to ramp up on, but my new team is
great, and I'm already hacking on some really cool stuff. I'm excited!

Sadly, I've [never](/space/2004-12-02_suburbia_ho)
[quite](/space/2009-05-31_looking_for_a_roommate_in_sf)
[managed](/space/2004-09-26_but_i_can_still_type)
to keep home and work in sync, and this is no exception. I'll be commuting yet
again, from SF to Mountain View. Still, I can't complain too much,
[all things considered](http://www.google.com/intl/en/jobs/lifeatgoogle/benefits/#bwbb).

Wish me luck with the new gig!
