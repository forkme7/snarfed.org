We spent the majority of our [vacation](/space/2009-10-27-back_from_vacation)
in Paris. I saw sights, visited museums, hunted for the
[perfect baguette](http://www.somebits.com/weblog/?q=paris+bread),
ate at
[great](http://www.pierre-gagnaire.com/)
[foodie](http://www.restaurants-joel-robuchon.com/modele.php?resto=2&ville=Paris&rub=presentation&image=1&langue=eng)
[restaurants](http://www.plaza-athenee-paris.com/alain-ducasse-plaza-athenee),
spent time with locals ([Jeremy](http://www.facebook.com/cotter)'s friends and
family) and generally tried to soak up as much as I could. It was great.

Here are some highlights and thoughts, in roughly chronological order. Also
see the [pictures](/gallery/paris_2009) (still in progress)!

  * The people watching hit me first. Lots of classically Gallic facial features!

  * Books, classical music, and other more "intellectual" parts of culture are
    more common and mainstream. The same thing struck me
    [when I visited Prague](/space/2006-09-14). Very cool.

  * Not that it's a surprise to anyone, but Paris felt _very_ urban, very big
    city, more New York than San Francisco. Some of that may be due to the
    strong central planning when it was originally built up. The spiral
    pattern of arrondisements was also interesting.

    Also, like many places in Europe, old, beautiful architecture is _everywhere_!
    Not just the landmarks, but ordinary buildings too. Old buildings in the
    US may be hundreds of years old, but old buildings in Paris are thousands
    of years old, and it shows.

  * [Chapelle St. Michelle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Chapelle), a
    smaller and lesser known but utterly beautiful chapel in the Latin
    Quarter, known for its overwhelming stained glass. We heard a small
    chamber music concert in the chapel, and even with scaffolding across one
    corner, it was a moving experience. The acoustics, in particular, were
    absolutely haunting.

  * On a related note, our hotel was in the Latin Quarter, centrally located
    in the 5th
    [arrondisement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_arrondissements)
    andjust minutes from the Seine river,
    [Notre Dame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Paris), and lots
    of other great neighborhoods and locations. It's largely a student
    neighborhood due to the universities nearby, but it's also drawn more
    tourists recently.

</div>

  * The [Champs-Élysées](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champs_Elysees) was a
    lot of fun. It definitely had that familiar, main thoroughfare in a big
    city feel, but the
    [Arc de Triomphe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomphe) and the
    history elevated it above similar streets in other cities.

  * Designer retail stores for car companies! Similar to Apple stores, but
    naturally a little larger. And in prime real estate on the Champs-Élysées,
    no less. I wonder if we'll see them here eventually too.

  * Like the Chappelle St. Michelle, Notre Dame was stunning, as much for
    the history behind it as for the exterior, interior, or the acoustics.
    Even the crowds and muted buzz of noise inside couldn't diminish the
    impact.

  * The [Louvre](http://www.louvre.fr/llv/commun/home.jsp?bmLocale=en). First,
    it's _massive_, both the building(s) and the collections. Even if you only
    tried to see the fraction of the collections that was exhibited at any one
    time, it would still easily take a solid week. Regardless, both the
    buildings and the
    [Tuilieres](http://www.louvre.fr/llv/musee/jardins_tuileries.jsp?bmLocale=en)
    gardens were well worth seeing.

    We also noticed that France and Spain intentionally placed modern art
    alongside classical art in a number of places. Most of these didn't work,
    at least for us, and often detracted from both. The Louvre's famous
    pyramid was one of the few exceptions, though. Not only did it seem to
    fit, it actually felt like a positive contribution.

  * Both the
    [Place de la Bastille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Bastille)
    and
    [Sacré-Cœur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilique_du_Sacré-Cœur,_Paris)
    were worth visiting, both for the architecture and the history.

  * [Montmartre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmartre) was particularly
    memorable. It's (yet another) beautiful, historic chapel, but it also
    boasts one of the best views of the city outside of the Eiffel Tower, and

  <a href="/gallery/paris_2009">
    <img src="/gallery/paris_2009/thumbs/salon_du_chocolat_fashion_show.jpg" /></a>
</div>

  * The [Salon du Chocolat](http://www.salonduchocolat.fr/) was awesome. It''s
    the first [chocolate](/space/chocolate) show I've been to, but it
    definitely won't be the last. There were lots of truffles and ganaches,
    cocoa butter cosmetics, demonstrations and talks, and other fun stuff.
    More to the point, I met people from lots of boutique French chocolatiers
    who were new to me and sourced from interesting places. Naturally, I
    bought way too much chocolate and regretted it when I had to pack for the
    flight back. :P

  * [Versailles](http://en.chateauversailles.fr/homepage) was one of my
    favorite parts of Paris. The palace itself as ridiculous, with gold leaf
    and frescoes and bas relief statues everywhere and not a square inch
    undecorated.
    [Veilhan Versailles](http://en.chateauversailles.fr/news/events/exhibitions/veilhan-versailles)'s
    embedded modern art pieces were disappointing, and distracting, especially
    the one in the
    [Hall of Mirrors](http://en.chateauversailles.fr/discover-the-estate/the-palace/the-palace/the-hall-of-mirrors),
    but we generally managed to tune them out.

    <div class="img-shadow" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px">

        <img src="/gallery/paris_2009/thumbs/versailles_gardens_ryan.jpg" /></a>
    </div>

    We spent more time in the
    [gardens](http://en.chateauversailles.fr/gardens-and-park-of-the-chateau-),
    though, and I'm glad we did. They were breathtaking. First, they're
    immense, and heavily wooded, reminding me of some parts of Stanford
    campus. Second, the original planning and layout has as much of an effect
    now as it did then. Parts of it played tricks with perspective and seemed
    like they could go on forever. Others contrasted intricate detail and
    untamed wilderness. Best of all, there were moments were I felt like I
    could get truly lost, out of sight of anyone else. away from any other
    people. It was easy to see how they made people of the royal court feel
    like they could explore and have real adventures without leaving the
    garden.

    At one point, we saw a couple people jogging in a remote area of the
    garden. I was very, very jealous. What an amazing place for a daily run,
    right?

  * The [Eiffel Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_tower). It may be
    cliched, but it's still damn impressive. Also, I'm a little embarrassed to
    admit it, but before I visited I actually thought more of it was enclosed.
    I didn't realize just how little of it was usable space.

    <img src="/gallery/paris_2009/thumbs/opera_house.jpg" /></a>
</div>

  * The [Palais Garnier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_Garnier) opera
    hall. Yet another gorgeous, utterly historic piece of Paris architecture.
    It may not hold up to the new
    [Opéra Bastille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Bastille) as an actual
    opera venue, but for what it is, it's stunning.

  * On our last night, an impromptu street performance by an ad hoc break
    dance crew in Plaza St Michelle. Simple, fun, surprisingly good, and
    very European.
