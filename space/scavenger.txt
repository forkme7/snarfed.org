Scavenger is a program that extracts email addresses from text and binary files
in any format. Email addresses are identified according to the [RFC
2822](http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt?number=2822) standard.

Usage: scavenger [INPUT FILES]... [OUTPUT FILE]

I wrote scavenger a while ago, before I knew that grep, regular expressions,
etc. could do this without breaking a sweat. However, scavenger is a clean,
simple example of good C++ style and practices.

To compile on \*nix, just run make. This should work with gcc 2.95 and up on any
\*nix platform; it has been tested on Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD.

To compile on Windows, use the included Visual C++ project files.
