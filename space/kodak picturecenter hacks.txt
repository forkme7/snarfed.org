kodak picturecenter hacks
[Kodak PictureCenter](http://picturecenter.kodak.com/) is one of many online
services for storing photos and sending them to friends. Like many others, it
only displays images at ridiculously low resolutions, and only lets you download
images at 768x576, at best. If you want better quality photos, you have to buy
them.

No thanks. Here's how to get the full-size images from PictureCenter.

  1. Go to the PictureCenter page for an album. (You should have received an
email with a link to this page.)

  2. Click on the 'View' tab, and click on a picture.

  3. Right-click on the picture, and select 'View Image'.

  4. The URL in your browser should look something like this:
[http://picturecenter.kodak.com/imagep/2239126934\_400.jpg?...](http://picturecenter.kodak.com/imagep/2239126934_400.jpg?...)

  5. See the number before _.jpg_? Change it to 999999. The URL should now look
like this:
[http://picturecenter.kodak.com/imagep/2239126934\_999999.jpg?..](http://picturecenter.kodak.com/imagep/2239126934_999999.jpg?..)

  6. Voila! Right-click and save, and you have the picture in its original size.

Evidently, PictureCenter can display images at any size. The size is encoded in
the URL, so we just ask for a size that's almost certainly larger than the
picture, and PictureCenter shows the image at its original size.

If I find out how to do this with other photo sites, I'll post instructions
here.
