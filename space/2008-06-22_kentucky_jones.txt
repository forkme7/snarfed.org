I've made it to a few of the films in [SF Indie](http://sfindie.com/)'s
[Hole in the Head](http://holehead.withoutabox.com/) film festival this
year, and they've all been a lot of fun.

Sure, they were indie films, so they were all low budget, and ranged from good
to abominable. Still, we had a great time at every one. They were shown in
intimate, classic theaters with trellises, beautiful pipe organs, and frescoes
on the walls and the ceilings. The crowd was mostly alternative and indie,
fitting the Mission area venues.

We went to our last show on Friday, 
the [Primitive Screwheads](http://www.primitivescrewheads.com/)'
[Kentucky Jones and the Carpet of Doom](http://holehead.withoutabox.com/festivals/event_item.php?id=16643), a
hilarious parody of Indiana Jones and other adventure movies. Highlights
included an Iranian wannabe Eminem, a "scientific" flying carpet, and a rock
monster that ate a giant pair of scissors but fell victim to butcher paper.
Classic.

Oddly enough for a film festival, it was actually a live performance. The
actors were awesome, and they brought the crowd into the action, climbing over
our seats, spraying us with water and fake rocks and plastic snakes, and
inviting us to boo the villainous "Patriot" and cheer for the heroic "Tucky."

Thanks for organizing, Raj!
