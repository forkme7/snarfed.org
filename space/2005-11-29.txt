The [whole draw group](/gallery/Draw_Group)
came back to the Farm to cheer Stanford on to victory in the [2005 Big
Game](/gallery/Big_Game_2005)!

...ok, well, not exactly. Four out of six of us live here, so only
[Bill](http://magrath.com/) and [Maulik](http://maulik.net/) had to travel.
Plus, [John](/gallery/Big_Game_2005/tailgate_john_the_traitor.jpg)
defected to the [dark side](http://berkeley.edu) a few years ago, and,
um...Stanford lost.

Regardless, we rallied a big group, tailgated in force, afterpartied in style,
and generally had a great time. [Pictures](/gallery/Big_Game_2005) are up, and
Maulik posted an awesome
[travelog](http://maulik.freeshell.net/Miki.pl?page=Big+Game+2005.miki) that's
worth reading.

And remember, _these are the ruuuules...and regulations!!!_
