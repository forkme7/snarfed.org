An Epic Weekend

OK, I know it's Friday - well, technically Saturday - , and I'm just now getting
around to posting about what I did last weekend. It was an epic weekend. Don't
worry, though, I didn't write an epic poem about it...[just a rather long
post.](Mauliks_Epic_Visit)

(Or, if you want, just go [straight to the pictures.](mauliks_visit_2004))
