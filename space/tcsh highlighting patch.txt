_This patch was
[applied on 8/23/2006](http://mx.gw.com/pipermail/tcsh/2006-August/003724.html).
It's included in tcsh versions 6.14.06 and later._

For the impatient:  
[Patch](/space/tcsh-highlight.patch) for [tcsh
6.14.00](http://www.tcsh.org/MostRecentRelease)

I use [tcsh](http://www.tcsh.org/) as my shell, and I love it. [This
patch](/space/tcsh-highlight.patch) adds to tcsh's
usability by highlighting some regions in reverse video.

Specifically, it highlights the match during incremental search, and in emacs
mode, the region between the mark and cursor. Highlighting is off by default; it
can be turned on by setting the shell variable _highlight_.

Here's a screenshot while the mark is
set:![/space/tcsh_highlighting_mark_region.png](/space/tcsh_highlighting_mark_region.png)

...and an incremental search

The patch applies cleanly against [tcsh
6.14.00](http://www.tcsh.org/MostRecentRelease). See the [discussion on the tcsh
list](http://mx.gw.com/pipermail/tcsh/2006-January/003536.html) for more
details.
