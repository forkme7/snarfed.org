I just got back from the first day of
[Google I/O](http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/),
and one of my favorite sessions wasn't Google related or even particularly
technical. It was [Ignite](http://ignite.oreilly.com/), a fast-paced collage of
talks that gives each presenter only 5 minutes total, 15 seconds per slide.

Naturally, Ignite talks tend toward the unusual.
[The ones I saw](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23igniteio) ranged
from the lighthearted to the esoteric to the absurd. They included a
(search engine) search for the meaning of life,
[rowing across the North Atlantic ocean](http://oarnorthwest.com/expeditions/),
battleship with
[real life scale model boats and guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_warship_combat),
and a deconstruction of
[funny cat pictures](http://icanhascheezburger.com/) by
[an expert](http://www.benhuh.com/press/). (Srsly.) The last speaker even found
Atlantis!

Too fun. I wonder if anything tomorrow will come close, at least in
entertainment value...
