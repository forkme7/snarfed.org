### Fillcode, new and improved! [![Icon-Permalink.png](/Icon-Permalink.png)](#)

<div class="img" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px">

</div>

[Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/) is great, but one of my pet peeves is
that while it can fill (ie wrap) plain text, it [can't fill source
code](/space/filling_code_in_emacs). A while back, I wrote
[fillcode](/space/fillcode), an Emacs minor mode that does just that.

Since I started writing more C++ at work, I noticed a few fillcode bugs that
happen often in cc-mode. Specifically, fillcode occasionally gets too excited
and fill more than just the current line. Also, it doesn't always handle
multi-line comments well.

I've posted a [new version](/space/fillcode) that fixes these bugs. _Update,
April 25. I've fixed yet another bug and posted [another new
version](/space/fillcode), 0.5._

Happy filling!
