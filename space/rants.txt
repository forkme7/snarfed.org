rants
I have a tendency to rant. Here are a couple.

[National security (aka Homeland Security), proactive vs. reactive, and why ID
checks don't work.](http://ryan.barrett.name/security.html)

[Tipping (waiters, cab drivers, etc.), why it's worse than useless, and how we
could stop.](http://ryan.barrett.name/tipping.html)

If you're looking for something with a little less vitriol, I've also written a
few [short stories](/space/writing). Frankly, they're much better than the
rants.
