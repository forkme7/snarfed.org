### Upsy Downsy

You may or may not have noticed, but yesterday
[snarfed.org](http://snarfed.org/) was down for a while, then up and down for a
while more. It should be up and stable now.

_[Nerd alert! Unless you're a nerd, stop reading now!]_

[SnipSnap](/space/SnipSnap), the server that runs this site, uses
[McKoi](http://mckoi.com/) as its embedded database, and the two have never had
an easy relationship. McKoi routinely gets corrupted and needs to be repaired.
This time it lost its head(er) entirely, and refused to be recovered.

Thankfully, I backup the site often, and I'd been meaning to upgrade SnipSnap
anyway so that I could dump Mckoi. This was just the straw that broke the
camel's back.

So, this site is now running [SnipSnap
1.0b1](http://snipsnap.org/space/version-1.0b1), using the file system as a
backing store. Other than better stability and uptime, you shouldn't notice many
differences.

Unfortunately, the upgrade did take a few casualties - specifically, my personal
site, [ryan.barrett.name](/ryan.barrett.name/), is temporarily down. With
[SnipSnap 0.4.2a](http://snipsnap.org/space/version-0.4.2a), I was able to
configure [Jetty](http://jetty.mortbay.org/) to [serve both
sites](http://snipsnap.org/space/virtual+host+redirection) from a single
SnipSnap instance...but SnipSnap 1.0b1 [chokes on
that](http://snipsnap.org/comments/virtual+host+redirection#comment-virtual%20host%20redirection-4).
I can get one site or the other up, but not both...and this site has all the
content, so [ryan.barrett.name](/ryan.barrett.name/) is down for now.
Hopefully not for long, though.
