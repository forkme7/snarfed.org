Last weekend, [Becca](http://myspace.com/beckstar_805) and I headed down to Big
Sur and camped out on [Gamboa Beach](http://jrabold.net/bigsur/roadpt0860.htm)
with 60 of our closest friends. The organizers brought a generator, turntables
and speakers, lights, volleyball net, a couple big grills, and lots of food and
drinks. The rest of us brought tents, sleeping bags, sunblock, and not much
else.

While we were there, we went hiking, swimming, and played in tide pools. More
than anything else, though, we relaxed on the beach. The weather was perfect,
and the coastline was absolutely gorgeous. I didn't think about work, or
anything else, for the better part of the weekend. It was really nice.

Thanks Serge!
