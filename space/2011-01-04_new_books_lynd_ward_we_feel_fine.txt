New books: Lynd Ward, We Feel Fine

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! As usual, [books](books) were a popular gift
with my family this year. There were a few particularly interesting ones among
the haul, so I thought I'd share them.

The first is
[Lynd Ward's _Woodcut Novels_](http://books.google.com/books?id=EOx1RAAACAAJ), a
collection of short stories told entirely in pictures, specifically
[woodcut prints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodcut). These are unlike
anything I've ever read. They're subtle, hauntingly beautiful, and not at all
acccessible. They stretch my brain in directions it doesn't stretch often. It's
an odd feeling, uncomfortable and invigorating at the same time.

[Scott McCloud](http://www.scottmccloud.com/)'s masterpiece
_[Understanding Comics](http://books.google.com/books?id=oJ1vPwAACAAJ)_
originally turned me onto Lynd Ward. Woodcut novels were an early predecessor to
comic books, aka graphic novels, and Ward's work is considered the pinnacle of
the form. It's no accident that
[Art Spiegelman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Spiegelman), the acclaimed
comic artist and author of
[Maus](http://books.google.com/books?id=ASajL1zsziAC), edited the collection.

(Incidentally, _Understanding Comics_ is one of the best books I read last year.
It doesn't matter if you read comics or not - I definitely don't - or even if
you care. _Understanding Comics_ has more insight into human nature and the
human brain than most poopular neuroscience books I've read recently.)

I discovered the second book,
_[We Feel Fine](http://wefeelfine.org/mission.html)_, when it was still just a
web art project from a [friend from work](http://kamvar.org/). He and his
co-creator pulled millions of blog posts into a database, extracted "I feel" and
"I am feeling" phrases, and did some basic data mining. They found interesting
and unexpected patterns, illustrated them with examples, exhibited
[on the web](http://www.wefeelfine.org/movements.html) and then
[in museums](http://www.wefeelfine.org/news.html), and finally
[published a book](http://www.wefeelfine.org/book/).

The result is similar to Ward's woodcut novels - haunting, affecting, often
uncomfortable, and entirely irresistible. It's particularly fascinating because
it marries such different fields: large scale, data driven, hard edged applied
computer science and individual, personal, fuzzy human emotion.

I'm reading and looking forward to a number of [other books](books) too, but
these are the most noteworthy. Thanks, family!
