thinkpad keys in firefox
![/space/thinkpad_keys.jpg](/space/thinkpad_keys.jpg)

I use a [Thinkpad
T43](http://www.pc.ibm.com/us/notebooks/thinkpad/t-series/index.html), and I
love it. Along with other Thinkpads and [IBM
keyboards](http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?partNumber=28L3644),
it has a couple little keys above the arrow keys that go "back" and "forward" in
your browser. At least, in Windows IE. Shockingly, they don't work with
[Firefox](http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/) (in Linux) out of the box.

**Update**: Rob Mayoff's
[howto](http://dqd.com/~mayoff/notes/thinkpad/dqdnavkeys/), originally for
[Mozilla](http://mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/), now includes Firefox. He's
done most of the work in a package that you can install with a single click. If
you just want your thinkpad keys to work already, [follow his
howto](http://dqd.com/~mayoff/notes/thinkpad/dqdnavkeys/).

Otherwise, here's the recipe for Firefox, versions 0.8 through 1.0. (It probably
works with earlier and later versions too, but no guarantees.)

First, you need to map the keys to X keysyms. There are in-depth instructions
[on the linux-thinkpad mailing
list](http://mailman.linux-thinkpad.org/pipermail/linux-thinkpad/2003-December/014440.html),
but all you need to do is add these two lines to ~/.Xmodmap:


    keycode 234 = F19

    keycode 233 = F20

and then reload it:


    $ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap

Now, you need to perform surgery on one of the jar files that Firefox uses to
configure itself. In the chrome/ subdirectory of your Firefox directory, unpack
the browser.jar file like so:


    $ cd firefox/chrome

    $ unzip browser.jar

Fire up your favorite text editor and open the content/browser/browser.xul file.
In the **<keyset id="mainKeyset">** section, find these lines:


    <key id="goBackKb"  keycode="VK\_LEFT"

         command="Browser:Back" modifiers="alt"/>

    <key id="goForwardKb"  keycode="VK\_RIGHT"

         command="Browser:Forward" modifiers="alt"/>

...and add these two lines immediately after them:


    <key id="goBackKb"  keycode="VK\_F19"

         command="Browser:Back"/>

    <key id="goForwardKb"  keycode="VK\_F20"

         command="Browser:Forward"/>

Repackage browser.jar, like so:


    $ zip -rD0 browser.jar content/browser/

If you weren't working in your firefox/chrome directory, copy the new
browser.jar over the existing one in firefox/chrome.

Restart Firefox, and you should be set! If not, feel free to [email
me](http://ryan.barrett.name/contact.html), and I'll try to help.
