We've
[just announced Google Cloud SQL](http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/10/google-cloud-sql-your-database-in-cloud.html),
a hosted relational database that does for MySQL what
[App Engine did](2008-04-07_google_app_engine_launched) for webapps. It handles
the plumbing and infrastructure so you're free to focus on your application. No
more DBA needed!

Cloud SQL is led by [Ken Ashcraft](https://profiles.google.com/kashcraft/), one
of my App Engine cofounders and a good friend, and has a great team behind it.
I'm not on the core team, but I did contribute the
[Python API](http://code.google.com/apis/sql/docs/developers_guide_python.html)
and the sample [guestbook](http://sql-guestbook.appspot.com/) and
[SQL shell](http://sql-shell.appspot.com/) apps in
[20% time](http://www.google.com/jobs/lifeatgoogle/englife/#content), which was
a lot of fun.

I'll always have a soft spot for the App Engine datastore, but I also know (and
tell people loudly) that it's not good for all use cases. Its query engine
doesn't support data mining or ad hoc, user-driven queries, nor does it
integrate with the existing SQL-based tools and ecosystem. Cloud SQL will and
does, and that's really exciting.

Congrats on the launch, guys! And for the rest of you,
[go check it out!](http://code.google.com/apis/sql/)
