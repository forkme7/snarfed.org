Public Service Announcement: don't buy
[Bad Mojo: Redux](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/badmojo/) from
[Got Game Entertainment](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/). Their
[DRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) has locked me
out of the game, despite the fact that I bought it legimately. They
were unable to fix it, and it took them a _month_ to offer a refund. I ended
up [fixing it myself...](/space/bad_mojo_redux_from_got_game_entertainment)
