It wasn't an official CodeCon event...but I've finally posted
[pictures](/gallery/Studio 767 Birthday Party) from Studio 767,
[Orkut](http://cs.stanford.edu/~orkut/) and [Ken](keeda.stanford.edu/~kash/)'s
birthday party.

It was incredibly, fantastically, over the top. Red carpet. Professional sound
and lights. An iPod turntable. Dancers. Fabulous people. A staff to guest ratio
comparable to a cruise. (Yes, you read that right.)

Most importantly, it rocked my socks...all the way...off. Happy birthday, guys!

(Thanks for the pictures, [Ferhat](http://ferhatphotography.com/studio767/) and
