The [table I bought and helped design](2010-04-12_dining_table_shopping) while I
was [on break](2010-05-07_back_to_work) is finally done! John from
[Live Edge](http://liveedge.com/) wrote me yesterday and told me it's in the
crate and should go out for shipping today. I'm psyched. I can't wait for it
to get here!

He also sent pictures, which made me even more excited. As with anything custom,
it had plenty of potential to turn out wrong or different from what I wanted,
but I'm very happy with the final result. The edges have the perfect amount of
character, the proportions feel right, and the wood and stain turned out
absolutely beautiful. I do wonder if the base plates have enough curve to them,
but I'm reserving judgment until I see them in person.

Regardless, it was a pleasure working with John and everyone else at Live Edge.
Thank you, guys!
