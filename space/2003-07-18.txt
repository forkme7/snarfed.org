It's Live!

Hi, and welcome to [snarfed.org](http://snarfed.org/). It's official, we've
launched!

I won't send a real announcement for a while yet, since we're still working on
the album...but at least it's at the right domain name, and it won't be going
anywhere soon.

Oh, and check it - [http://kash.stanford.edu/](http://kash.stanford.edu/) still
serves its content, as usual, even though snarfed.org and kash are both running
off the same server, both on port 80. How, you ask? Through the magic of
[Jetty](http://snipsnap.org/space/virtual+host+redirection)!
