#
# Downloads all of the pictures in a Picasa Web album. Just give it the album's
# RSS feed, and it will pull down all of the full-size pictures.
#
# Usage: download_picasa_album.sh RSS_FEED
#
# The script itself is dirt simple. If you're looking for something robust and
# full-featured, you probably want an RSS reader that supports enclosures or a
#dedicated web photo downloader instead. This is simpler, though, which I like.
