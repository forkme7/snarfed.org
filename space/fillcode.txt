Fillcode is an [Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/) minor mode that fills, or
wraps, some parts of source code. It's best described by example. Fillcode fills
this:

    public static void foo(int i, float f, String s) {

to this:

    public static void foo(int i, float f,
                           String s) {

The motivation is described in my original [call for filling
code](/space/filling code in emacs).

Fillcode can fill any parenthesized expression, including function prototypes,
function calls, and conditional expressions. It only breaks lines at commas and
binary operators, and correctly preserves embedded comments and string literals.
It also normalizes existing whitespace and line breaks.

Fillcode is supported in both [Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/) and
[XEmacs](http://xemacs.org/), and works with most programming language major
modes, including Java, C, C++, Objective C, Perl, Python, shell, and SQL modes.
It fills when _fill-paragraph_ (usually M-q) is called. If the major mode itself
attempts to fill - inside a comment, for example - fillcode graciously steps
back and does nothing.

You can load fillcode automatically by copying
[fillcode.el](/space/fillcode.el) into _/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/_,
or any other directory in Emacs' _load-path_. Then, add this to your .emacs
file:

    (require 'fillcode)

_M-x fillcode-mode_ toggles fillcode on and off in the current buffer. To turn
it on automatically whenever you open source code, add these lines to your
.emacs file.

    (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'fillcode-mode)
    (add-hook 'perl-mode-hook 'fillcode-mode)
    (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'fillcode-mode)
    (add-hook 'shell-script-mode-hook 'fillcode-mode)
    (add-hook 'sql-mode-hook 'fillcode-mode)

Fillcode is a work in progress. Here's a list of issues:

  * It doesn't yet fill expressions outside parentheses.
  * It doesn't break lines at the =, >, and < operators.
  * It depends on the major mode's indentation and parsing engines. These are
less than perfect in some major modes.
  * It's not entirely compatible with
[auto-fill-mode](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html#Auto%20Fill)
or [filladapt-mode](http://www.wonderworks.com/#filladapt)...yet.
  * Single-line comments, such as **//** and **#** comments, aren't handled
perfectly. Specifically, the following lines aren't always indented.
