faking out address and credit card forms

Like many people, I buy
things online. Unlike many people, I'm a bit of a privacy freak. I only use
[anonymous prepaid debit cards](/space/privacy_through_prepaid_credit_cards),
and I don't give out my real name, address, birthdate, or other personal
information. If I'm buying something that needs to be shipped, I use a mail
drop, not my home address.

Of course, most web sites ask for name, address, and phone number whether or
not they need it. Some also check them against the name and address on your
credit card using
[AVS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Verification_System).

Regardless, I avoid giving out my information. I've been keeping track of what
can be ignored, what can be faked, and what has to be real on many ecommerce
web sites I've used.

Of course, this is only useful when they don't actually need your info. If
you're having something shipped to you, or you're giving an address for legal
purposes, you'll obviously need to use a real address. For services that don't
need your address, though, or only need a billing address, this is fair game.

Note: I don't discuss email addresses. If you don't want to give out your real
email address, but need an email address that you can receive email and reply
from to "verify" it, consider [Mailinator](http://mailinator.com/), [plus
addressing in
GMail](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1865178,00.asp), or a [vanity
domain](http://dict.die.net/vanity%20domain/).

Also note: When I say _dashes for everything else_, you'll sometimes need to
put in an ok-_looking_ zip code and/or phone number. 00000 and 000-000-0000
will almost always work.
