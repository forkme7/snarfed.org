George...who?

I'm psyched for the final four...but as always, the tournament has been so
chaotic this year it's silly. No #1 seeds in the final four. Brackets have gone
to hell. The championship doesn't come close to representing the season as a
whole.

But the most pressing question, honestly, is [who the heck is George
Mason?](http://ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/gamecenter/recap/NCAAB_20060326_GEOMAS@CT)

p.s. Am I bitter that Stanford always kicked butt during the season, then fell
apart as soon as the tournament started? Um...maybe, just a little.
