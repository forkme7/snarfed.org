Family Reunion 2009: Gulf Shores, Alabamaa

For our family reunion this year, we
[rented a big house on the beach in Gulf Shores](http://snarfed.org/space/2009-07-11_vacation).
We hung out on the beach and by the pool, went bowling miniature golfing, cooked
and ate _great_ food. Gotta love vacation!
