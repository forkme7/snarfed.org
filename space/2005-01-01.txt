John Tannaci, one of my drawmates at Stanford, [was recently
married](http://weddings.theknot.com/pwp/view/co_main.aspx?coupleid=106610653775340)
to the love of his life, Julie Kliewer. Well, ok, not recently...but wedding
photographers take a _long_ time. Anyway, I was a groomsman, and I managed to
not mess up the ceremony too badly. Check out the
[pictures](/gallery/John_and_Julies_Wedding)!
