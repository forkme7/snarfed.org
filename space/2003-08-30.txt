### It's alive!!!

We're baaaaaaack! The server was down for a couple weeks while we all moved (and
moved, and moved again), but its back up in it's new home...[ken](/space/kash)'s
new house!

Oh, also, if you're a regular at
[http://kash.stanford.edu/](http://kash.stanford.edu/) , you'll want to update
your bookmark to point to [http://kash.snarfed.org/](http://kash.snarfed.org/) .
Enjoy!
