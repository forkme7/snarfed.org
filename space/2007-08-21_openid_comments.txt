OpenID comments

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px">

A while back, I posted an
[OpenID server plugin](/space/2006-10-20) for
[PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.sf.net/), the software that runs this site.

Since then, I've added support for
[OpenID comments](/space/2007-08-21_openid_comments#comment-anchor), using
the [comments_openid.py plugin](/space/pyblosxom+openid+comments).
I've updated it to work with recent versions of PyBlosxom and
[JanRain](http://www.janrain.com/)'s
[Python OpenID library](http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/libraries/python/),
and to use the nickname provided by the
[Simple Registration Extension](http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/simple-registration-extension).

Feel free to [try it out](/space/2007-08-21_openid_comments#comment-anchor)! If
you don't have an OpenID yet, you can get one at
[MyOpenID](http://www.myopenid.com/).
