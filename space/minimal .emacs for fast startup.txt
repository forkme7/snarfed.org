minimal .emacs for fast startup
[![gnu.jpg](/space/gnu.jpg)](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/)

I
spend a fair amount of time ssh-ed into remote, headless linux servers. I often
need to use a text editor to edit configuration files. Most don't run X windows,
so I can't run [emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/), my editor of choice, in
graphical mode. I could use emacs -nw, which starts emacs in text mode, but
emacs is still fairly heavy by default. These editing sessions are usually quick
and simple, and I wouldn't want to wait for a full-blown emacs to start every
time.

I used [pico](http://www.washington.edu/pine/man/#pico) for a while, since I use
[pine](http://washington.edu/pine/) as my email client. However, I missed emacs'
depth and versatility. I considered [vi](http://vim.org/), but I wasn't exposed
to it in the womb, and I'm not sure there's any other way to learn it. :P

More importantly, I didn't like using two different editors. [Mental context
switches](http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html) are evil
incarnate, and switching between text editors is a big context switch.

So, I set out to make the minimal emacs -nw setup - lightwight, fast to start,
and still usable for casual editing. It actually turned out to be fairly easy. I
use this command to start emacs:

    emacs -nw --no-init-file --no-site-file \
      --load .emacs.minimal

and this elisp in my [my minimal
.emacs](/space/dotfiles/emacs):

    ; cutoff for word wrap
    (setq-default fill-column 79)

    ; F12 toggles auto-fill mode
    (global-set-key [f12] 'auto-fill-mode)

    ; C-- keybinding for undo (removes the shift)
    (global-set-key [(control -)] 'undo)

    ; turn on pending delete (when a region
    ; is selected, typing replaces it)
    (delete-selection-mode t)

    ; when on a tab, make the cursor the tab length
    (setq-default x-stretch-cursor t)

    ; avoid garbage collection (default is only 400k)
    (setq-default gc-cons-threshold 4000000)

    ; turn on random customization options
    (custom-set-variables
      '(sentence-end-double-space nil)
      '(truncate-partial-width-windows nil)
      '(line-number-mode t)
      '(column-number-mode t)
      '(query-user-mail-address nil)
      '(visible-bell t))

Your .emacs file is fairly personal, so you'll probably want to customize it and
add things from your standard .emacs. [dotemacs.de](http://www.dotemacs.de/) is
a good resource for writing and refining your .emacs file.
