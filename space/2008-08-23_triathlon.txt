I ran my first triathlon last weekend!
[Ken and Tina](http://kenandtina08.com/) and I stayed at
[my parents' place]() Friday night, got up at 5am Saturday morning, headed
down to
[Shadow Cliffs Regional Park](http://www.ebparks.org/parks/shadow_cliffs), set
up our gear, and started on the
[Tri For Fun](http://www.onyourmarkevents.com/TriForFunInfo.htm)
course at 7am.

I only decided to do it a couple days before, so I hadn't exactly been
training. Worse, I ended up going in the second wave, which was pretty
competitive. I don't swim much, I'd borrowed Ken's mountain bike, so both of
those sections were pretty challenging.

I run pretty regularly, though, so I figured I'd make up time on that part. I
pushed hard on the bike, though, so when I got off and started to run, I
almost fell over. My legs felt like they'd been beaten with a bat! I'm
definitely not used to biking.

Even so, I cranked through the run and ended up clocking in at under 1:15,
which I was happy with. I'll have to do it again next year! In the meantime,
