Filling code in Emacs

[Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/) is great, but one of my pet peeves is
that while it can fill (ie wrap) plain text, it [can't fill source
code](filling_code_in_emacs).

I've recently been working on [fillcode](fillcode), an Emacs minor mode
that does this. It's best described by example. Fillcode fills this:

    public static void foo(int i, float f, String s) {

to this:

    public static void foo(int i, float f,
                           String s) {

Fillcode can fill any parenthesized expression, including function prototypes,
function calls, and conditional expressions. It only breaks lines at commas and
binary operators, and correctly preserves embedded comments and string literals.
It also normalizes existing whitespace and line breaks.

It's not perfect yet, but I've put up an [initial release](fillcode).
Feel free to check it out, or just [download
fillcode.el](fillcode.el) and go to town. And if you do, please
[let me know](about) what you think!
