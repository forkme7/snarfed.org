Double negatives don't make you (sound) smart

Have you ever heard someone use a double negative phrase like "not unlikely," or
"impossible not to," particularly in intellectual discussion or writing? These
phrases are evidently called [litotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litotes).
Plenty of
[other people](http://www.quora.com/Is-it-pretentious-to-use-a-double-negative-e-g-not-uncommon)
[have noticed](http://painintheenglish.com/case/4012) them too, most famously
George Orwell in his essay
_[Politics and the English Language](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm)_:

I'm a fan of the
[Strunk and White](http://books.google.com/books?id=IAy6NCD0Iq0C) school of
thought: say it as simply and briefly as you can. That keeps the focus on the
message itself, as opposed to the medium or presentation. I find that my best
writing and talks happen only after I cut and edit down as much as possible. The
message has to dig out from under my own unnecessary layers of writing, revision
by revision, before it can shine on its own.

Litotes are one of those unnecessary layers. If something is not uncommon, it's
simpler and clearer to say it's common. If there's no lack of something, there's
an abundance of it, or even better, there's a lot of it. Skip the rhetoric and
just say so!

I get why litotes are attractive. In particular, they're a way to hedge or
downplay a claim. Smart people tend to know their own limitations, and if
they're talking about something that's even a bit uncertain, litotes are a
simple way to convey that uncertainty.

Still, if you're smart, and you're talking about something meaningful, your
audience is probably smart too. They know that things are rarely black and
white, and they know when a topic is too broad or complex to be absolutely
certain. Why cover your ass with opaque rhetoric if your audience already gets
it?

Sadly, I've picked up the bad habit, and I use litotes occasionally too. How
about this: I'll quit if you quit. Deal?
