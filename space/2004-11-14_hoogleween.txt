Just like [Michael Keaton on Celebrity
Jeopardy](http://snltranscripts.jt.org/97/97bjeopardy.phtml), I was Batman for
Halloween. I can't take credit for it, though...my whole team decided to be
Batman characters, and I had some very inspired help with the costume. I've also
posted the [rest of the pictures](Halloween_at_Google_2004) from Google's
Halloween party.
