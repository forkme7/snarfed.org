Facebook to WordPress

[facebook_to_wordpress.py](https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/master/facebook_to_wordpress.py)
is a script that copies your [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) posts to a
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) blog of your choice. It helps you get more
control over your posts, pictures, and other online memories, following in the
spirit of the [Indie Web movement](2012-07-25_why_i_have_my_own_web_site).

I've used it to copy a number of my own Facebook posts to this web site. Here are a
few examples:

Usage: `facebook_to_wordpress.py XMLRPC_URL USERNAME PASSWORD < FILENAME`

It Rreads one or more Facebook posts in Graph API JSON representation from stdin
and publishes them to a WordPress blog via XML-RPC. It includes and formats
pictures, locations (ie checkins), links, tagged people, comments, and a link
back to the original post.


You can use the
[Graph API Explorer](http://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer) to download
your posts in JSON format:



Facebook also lets you [download your data](https://www.facebook.com/download/)
as a set of HTML pages and images in a zip file. It's not as useful for
publishing on the web, but if you just want an archive of your data, or if you
want to publish it as static, read-only pages, it's an option.
