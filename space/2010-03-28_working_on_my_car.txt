I've been doing lots of different things in my
[free time between jobs](2010-03-13_new_job). One of the most fun
was working on [my car](Ford_Mustang_-_1965_vs._2006) the other day.

Of course, it's a modern car, so it's stuffed with microchips and
["no user serviceable parts"](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/02/no-user-servica.html)
under the hood, and I haven't had the years of specialized school that you need
to be an auto mechanic nowadays, so I didn't touch the engine block or drivetrain.
itself. I just wanted to add aux input to the stereo so I could connect it
to an MP3 player.

Happily - and surprisingly - the electrical side hasn't changed as much over
the years as the stuff under the hood. With the help of an
[aftermarket adaptor](http://pie.net/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=45&category_id=96&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=40),
some
[tap-in connectors from Radio Shack](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2104093)
that are _way_ easier than stripping wires and soldering by hand,
and a [helpful guide](http://home.comcast.net/~murzim/site/?/page/Mustang_Interface/),
it was pretty straightforward.

Most importantly, though, it works! The car speakers are so much nicer than
headphones. Gotta love free time!
