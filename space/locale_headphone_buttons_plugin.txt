[Locale Headphone Buttons Plugin](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.snarfed.android.headphonebuttons)
is a plugin for the [Locale](http://www.twofortyfouram.com/) Android app that
simulates pressing a headphone or headset button. Available buttons are the
"hook" ie single headset button, Play/Pause, Play, Pause, Next, Previous, Fast
Forward, Rewind, Stop.

This is useful because headphone buttons automatically use the current
"preferred" media player, which is usually the most recently used one, instead
of any specific player.

The app is open source and released into the public domain.
[Download the code](locale_headphone_buttons_plugin.tar.bz2).
