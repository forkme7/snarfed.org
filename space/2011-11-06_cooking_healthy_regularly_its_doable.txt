Cooking healthy, regularly: it's doable

One of my favorite perks of working at Google
[is](http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/fortune/0701/gallery.Google_food/)
[the](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/googleplex2.htm)
[food](http://www.foodpolitics.com/2011/07/googles-impressive-healthy-food-program/).
Sure it's free, but it's also healthy, good, consistently interesting, and
available 24/7. Whenever I consider going anywhere else, a little voice inside
my head always asks, "but will you eat as well?"

I recently had the chance to find out. I'm month into a short sabbatical, and
I've happily discovered that, yes, I still eat as well. I've gone from making
around three dinners a week to making six breakfasts, lunches, and dinners, and
the food is still interesting, tasty, quick, and good for me. Google's food may
still be better, but mine is a lot closer than I expected.

First, some disclaimers. Health, nutrition, and variety matter, but so does
time investment. I enjoy cooking, but it's not a passion or a lifestyle, and I'm
slow and inefficient in the kitchen. Cooking every day and night, or even every
other night, is a non-starter.

I don't mind eating the same foods a few days in a row, though, nor do I need to
"match" my dishes into an appropriate whole. Teriyaki fish, glazed yams, and
meditteranean greens? Sounds good to me!

My overarching goal was just to get close enough to the food I had at work. I
wasn't trying to learn to cook, change my diet or habits, lose (or gain) weight,
or anything else.

I owe my success to two key things: _proactive shopping_ and _cooking in
batches_.

First, _proactive shopping_.
[Self control is a limited resource](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion),
so instead of running out, I try to prevent situations where I'll need it. Full
cookie jar on the counter? Sure, I could use my steely willpower, but it's a lot
easier if I don't bake the cookies in the first place. As with other parts of
life, structuring food like this means better routines, less
[decision fatigue](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html)
and [context switching](http://snarfed.org/2011-05-29_dont_juggle_bubbles), and
more mental energy for the stuff I care about.

Surprisingly, the hero of the story here is our
[CSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture), that warm
fuzzy hippie California favorite. This was originally Gina's idea - I'm not
dogmatic about local or organic - but I love that it automatically delivers a
wide variety of fresh produce every week. The key word is automatic: it _forces_
us to cook a solid, ongoing baseline of good vegetables. Add in a shopping list
makeover, prune down the staples to just healthy foods that we'll still happily
eat, and the daily diet looks pretty good.

Next, an oldie but a goodie: _cooking in batches_. Only one or two people in the
household? Cook six or eight servings, throw the extra in the fridge, and eat it
over the next few days. We double down on this by cooking at least a few dishes
each time. We'll cook up a storm and spend the next five days eating different
combinations leftovers, supplemented with ready-to-eat foods like nuts, beans,
and olives. The amortizing cuts the time investment way down.

Don't get me wrong. When I go back to work, I'll count my blessings and scarf
down the food like it's manna from heaven. Still, it's nice to know that cooking
isn't such a big deal. Structured right, I can eat well and still have time for
the rest of life!
