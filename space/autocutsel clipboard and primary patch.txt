autocutsel clipboard and primary patch

[![/space/clip.png](/space/clip.png)](https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?func=detailitem&#38;item_id=3367)

For the impatient:  
[Patch for autocutsel 0.7.0](/space/autocutsel_unified.v2.patch)  
[Autocutsel page](http://www.nongnu.org/autocutsel/)

I love [Firefox](http://mozilla.org/firefox/), but there are a few things about
it that annoy me. For example, [you can't paste the primary selection from the
keyboard.](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228011) I
[tried](/space/linking+libraries+with+mozilla+xpcom)
[hard](/space/trigger+scripts+for+mozilla+xpi+packages) to fix
this in mozilla itself, but in the end, I failed. :/

However, I found a great program called
[autocutsel](http://www.nongnu.org/autocutsel), written by Michael Witrant,
which synchronizes the cutbuffer and an X selection. With [a little
help](https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?func=detailitem&item_id=3367), it now
synchronizes both the clipboard and the primary selection. Problem solved!
