I use [Ion](http://iki.fi/~tuomov/ion/) as my window manager, and I love it.
It's written by [Tuomo Valkonen](http://iki.fi/~tuomov/), who says it's _"a
tiling tabbed window manager designed with keyboard users in mind."_ I just say
it rocks.

The [Ion web site](http://iki.fi/~tuomov/ion/),
[FAQ](http://iki.fi/~tuomov/ion/faq.html), [wiki](http://wiki.ael.be/ion/), and
[mailing list](https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/ion-general) cover all
the bases, so I don't have anything new to add to them. However, I've posted my
[workspace and config files](dotfiles/.ion2). Enjoy!
