This patch adds an option to [Pine](http://www.washington.edu/pine/) that
deletes all attachments from messages when you save them. Both [MIME
multipart](http://www.washington.edu/pine/faq/whatis.html#2.4) attachments and
standard file attachments are deleted. They're replaced with a message that
describes the deleted attachment, just like manually deleted attachments.

If this feature is enabled, the Delete and Undelete commands in the [Attachment
Index](http://www.washington.edu/pine/faq/attachments.html#7.6) screen are
replaced with the Preserve command. You may Preserve individual attachments, and
they will not be deleted when their message is saved.

As background, email usage has evolved and large attachments are now common.
Also, modern mailers often send the same message in both HTML and plain text,
using MIME multipart attachments. This means that attachments can quickly take
up a large amount of space in your mailbox. If you have a quota on your mail
server, this feature can help prevent attachments from using up your quota.

This patch was inspired in part by a
[post](http://mailman1.u.washington.edu/pipermail/pine-info/2005-June/042501.html)
to the [pine-info](http://www.washington.edu/pine/pine-info/) mailing list.

bug reports.
