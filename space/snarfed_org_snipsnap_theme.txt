[SnipSnap](http://snipsnap.org/), the server that <strike>runs</strike> used to
run this site, supports [themes](http://snipsnap.org/space/Themes). They change
your SnipSnap-based site's appearance, using
[CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/), images, and other files, without changing
its content. There's a [tutorial](http://snipsnap.org/space/Theme+Tutorial) on

The snarfed.org theme is [available for download](snarfed_theme.snip).
To try it out on your site,
[download snarfed_theme.snip](snarfed_theme.snip), go to your
SnipSnap's setup page, import it, and set it as your theme. Voila!
