webalizer nofollow patch
[![/space/webalizer.png](/space/webalizer.png)](http://webalizer.com/)

For the impatient:  
[Patch for Webalizer 2.01-10](/space/webalizer_nofollow.patch)  
[Webalizer source](http://webalizer.com/download.html)  
[Google's nofollow
page](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html)

The latest salvo in the battle against [referrer spam](/space/referrer spam) and
comment spam is
[nofollow](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html),
an HTML tag that instructs search engines not to count a link in their
algorithms. It's not much, but for my part, I've written a trivial
[patch](/space/webalizer_nofollow.patch) that adds
nofollow support to [webalizer](http://webalizer.com/), a popular web server log
analyzer.

You can see this on the [webalizer site
statistics](http://ryan.barrett.name/usage/) for snarfed.org and
ryan.barrett.name. Check out that shiny new nofollow bling!
