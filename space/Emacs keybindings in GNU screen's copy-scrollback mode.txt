When I'm working, I pretty much
live inside [Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/). It's my IDE, debugger, text
editor, email composer, spreadsheet, file manager, and all-around scratch pad.

I've burned Emacs' key bindings into my brain, so I go to great lengths to set
them in every program I use. That way, I don't have to context switch my
fingers' muscle memory when I task switch from coding to email, to IM, to the
web. Task switches may be a fact of life, but other unnecessary mental context
switches are evil incarnate.

I recently started using [GNU screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)'s
[copy/scrollback mode](http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/screen/screen_73.html) so
that I could copy from terminals with the keyboard. I use these commands in [my
.screenrc](http://ryan.barrett.name/dotfiles/.screenrc) to set up Emacs key
bindings in screen's copy/scrollback mode:


    \# emacs keybindings for navigation in copy mode

    markkeys h=^B:l=^F:0=^A:$=^E

    markkeys " =^ "






      1. special hack for C-e, since it should go *past*



      2. the last char. -m means this is for copy mode only.





    bindkey -m ^e stuff "$^f"






      1. C-g and other keys just quit copy mode. Esc does nothing.





    markkeys 033=015=^G=^D=h=j=k=l=H=M=L=G=g=y=c=v=a=x=b=e=B=E=w

    markkeys @=033






      1. control arrows move by words. (set B, e, and w to F keys so that i can
use



      2. them to move by words, but they themselves still quit copy mode.)





    markkeys B=[:E=]:b={:e=}:w=>

    bindkey -m ^[Od stuff {  #"[[}"

    bindkey -m ^[Oc stuff ]  #"}]^f"
