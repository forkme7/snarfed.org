MAlbum

### Introduction

I am certain every digital shutter-bug has their own workflow for archiving and
sharing their digital photos. My workflow maintains an archive of every photo I
take, organized by date, and a second set of albums that are for sharing. In the
past, I would need to manually copy the photos that I wanted to share and then
use and application to generate the web pages/thumbnails etc. so that I could
share these pictures. I wanted to streamline my workflow into a single
application.

So I present: **MAlbum: Maulik's Album application**
