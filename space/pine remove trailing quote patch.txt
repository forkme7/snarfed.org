I use [Pine](http://www.washington.edu/pine/) as my email client, and I really
like it. It's fast, simple, full-featured, and very keyboardable. However,
nothing's perfect, even Pine.

This patch adds an option to Pine that removes _trailing quotes_ from messages
when you send them, or when you hit a keystroke. What's a trailing quote, you
ask? It's best described by example. The last three lines in this email are a
trailing quote:

I wrote this patch to make it easier to observe proper netiquette when quoting.
If you want to quote the smallest relevant piece of an email, you often need to
delete a significant amount of quoted text. This is especially true if you
correspond with people who top-post. (ick!) This patch automates the drudgery of
trimming that excess quoted text.

For more on the top- vs. bottom-post debate, see:

Also, a few recent email clients, such as [GMail](http://gmail.com/), try to use
quoted text to do smart things. This patch can make your emails more readable in
those clients. (I've discussed my thoughts on [gmail vs pine](/space/gmail vs
pine) at length. :P)

Feel free to [email me](http://ryan.barrett.name/contact.html) with feedback or
bug reports.

_Known bug_: Whole quotes are not detected correctly if you start your email
with (C)ompose instead of (R)eply. This is usually encountered when you reply to
an email, postpone the reply, then resume and attempt to send.
