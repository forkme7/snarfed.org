Clara's Birthday 2009

For
[Clara](http://www.insidefacebook.com/2007/10/21/interview-with-clara-shih-co-creator-of-faceforce/)'s
birthday, we all went to
[Aziza](http://www.aziza-sf.com/)
for dinner and drinks. Highlights included
[Kara's cupcakes](http://karascupcakes.com/),
new friends, tipsy but heartfelt toasts, and a
[herd of awkward giraffes](http://snarfed.org/gallery/claras_birthday_2009/awkward_giraffes_max_ryan_cynthia.jpg)!
