Don't juggle bubbles! (or, why I run shells inside Emacs)

[Mental context switches](http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html)
are evil. Some people handle them better than others, but not me. I handle them
worse. I feel it, almost physically, when context switches whittle down my
precious [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) piece by piece.
It hurts!

Even something as small as switching between
[Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/) and the shell can hurt, especially when
I do it thousands of times a day. The physical movement isn't so bad; it's that
they have different key bindings, different clipboards, and myriad deeper
differences in behavior. What's worse, only *some* parts are different, so my
muscle memory is constantly seduced into a false sense of familiarity, only to
have the rug yanked out from under it seconds later.

I [put](emacs_keybindings_in_gnu_screens_copy-scrollback_mode)
[together](control_arrow_keys_in_rxvt_tcsh_and_emacs)
[various](minimal_emacs_for_fast_startup)
[hacks](synchronizing_gnu_screens_paste_buffer_and_the_x_selection) to bring
Emacs and my shell closer together, with some success, but it always felt like a
chronic disease. Curing it completely was never on the table; I could only hope
to manage it.

The holy grail, of course, was running shells *inside* Emacs. I had high hopes
when I [tried it eight years ago](why_i_dont_run_shells_inside_emacs), but it
didn't work out. I tried it again recently though, and it's still early days,
but we're pretty happy together this time. I think we might go the distance!
