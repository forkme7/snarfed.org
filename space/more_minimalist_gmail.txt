More Minimalist Gmail userstyle

[more_minimalist_gmail.css](more_minimalist_gmail.css) is a
[userstyle](http://userstyles.org/help/userstyles) that hides most of Google
Gmail's UI, leaving simplified view of your email, labels, and search box. It's
intended for people who primarily use Gmail via the keyboard.

It was inspired by [Matt Constantine](http://mattconstantine.com/)'s
[Minimalist Gmail](http://mattconstantine.com/mg) browser extension, which I
used for a while and liked. It's out of date, though, and the userstyle goes
further, hides more, and since it's a userstyle, is much simpler.

More Minimalist Gmail also has
[its own page](http://userstyles.org/styles/35678) on
[userstyles.org](http://userstyles.org/).
