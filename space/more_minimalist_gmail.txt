More Minimalist Gmail

[more_minimalist_gmail.css](more_minimalist_gmail.css) is a
[userstyle](http://userstyles.org/help/userstyles) that hides most of Gmail's UI
and chrome, leaving only your email, labels, and search box. It's intended for
people who primarily use Gmail via the keyboard.

It was inspired by
[Matt Constantine](http://mattconstantine.com/)'s
[Minimalist Gmail](http://mattconstantine.com/mg), which I used for a while and
very much liked. However, the userstyle goes much further, hides more,
and since it's a userstyle, is much simpler.

More Minimalist Gmail also has
[its own page](http://userstyles.org/styles/35678) on
[userstyles.org](http://userstyles.org/).
