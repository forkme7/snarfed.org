snarfed.org has been around [since early 2002](/space/snarfed.org_history).
It's hosted at
[pair.com](http://pair.com/) on a
[shared FreeBSD server](http://pair.com/services/web_hosting/).
It currently runs on [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) and the
[snarfed theme](/).
It used to run on [PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.sf.net/)
with a custom PyBlosxom
[flavour](/space/snarfed.org_PyBlosxom_flavour) and
[plugins](/space/software).
Before that, it ran on
[SnipSnap](http://snipsnap.org/), on a
[Linux VPS](http://jvds.com/linux.php) at
