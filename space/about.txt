Welcome to [our](/space/contact) home. It's brand new, so
please wipe your feet and mind the exposed beams. This is where we hang our hat,
the place we come home to and put our feet up and relax after a hard day's work.

For many good years at [school](http://www.stanford.edu/), we had [real
homes](http://rescomp.stanford.edu/dorms/row/xanadu/), with roofs that leaked
and doors that creaked and couches that sighed, just a little, when you sat
down. They weren't perfect - hell, sometimes they were downright broken - but
they were ours.

However, like all good things, sharing a [real
home](http://rescomp.stanford.edu/dorms/row/xanadu/) came to an
[end](/gallery/Graduation+2002). Now, we're scattered all over the world. Some of
us are at [new](http://www.asu.edu/)[ schools](http://www.berkeley.edu/),
[some](http://www.tgen.org/)[ have](http://www.nsa.gov/)
[jobs](http://google.com/), and the lucky ones still haven't come down to earth
quite yet. But none of us have forgotten that leave-the-light-on,
hug-your-aunt-mabel, gather-around-the-table-and-carve-the-turkey feeling.
Hopefully we never will.

So make yourself comfortable and enjoy your stay, but please, tread lightly. It
may not be much, but it's our home. And some of us are trying to
[sleep](http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2003/march19/dement.html).
