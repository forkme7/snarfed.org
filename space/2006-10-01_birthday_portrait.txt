Every year, around the time the leaves start turning and the air gets crisp, my
birthday rolls around...and every year, when people ask what to get me, I'm
inevitably at a loss.

I like to count my blessings. I'm happy, healthy, I have a good job and a roof
over my head, and I don't really want for very much. That doesn't fly with
family and friends, though, who _have to get me a present, dammit, and why do I
always have to be so difficult_?!

I tried pointing them to my [books](books),
[chocolate](chocolate), and [games](games) lists. That worked for
a few years, but they eventually saw through it. _We can't do that again, we're
supposed to get you something good!_

Well, this year they outdid themselves. Along with an incredible
[homemade pecan galette](http://www.thecosmopolitancafe.com/sd_pages.cfm?pageid=109) and
[The Wire](http://hbo.com/thewire/) on DVD,
I received a striking
[portrait](http://www.artwanted.com/imageview.cfm?id=400613&SubGal=Portraits)
from my sister. Even better,
[I can share it with you](http://www.artwanted.com/imageview.cfm?id=400613&SubGal=Portraits)!

It was a hit at the party. Everyone gushed about how much it
captured one of my most memorable expressions, and
[Ken](https://profiles.google.com/kashcraft)'s, with just a few brush
strokes. I can't wait to put it up in my office. Thanks,
