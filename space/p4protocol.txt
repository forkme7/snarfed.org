1) INTRODUCTION
---------------

P4 is a distributed, peer-to-peer network platform with an extensible plugin
architecture. This allow developers to build their own network-aware
applications without having to recreate middle-level network services. The P4
platform provides middle-level services including user location and
authentication, broadcast and direct send/receive, common application
discovery, and data encryption. (For more information on developing with the P4
platform, see the P4 API Specification.) Due to its peer-to-peer design, the P4
protocol is highly fault-tolerant. This is critical, as the network is expected
to have a high turnover rate in terms of the connected hosts.


2) PROTOCOL DEFINITION
----------------------

The P4 protocol defines how P4 clients communicate with each other to provide
the services described above. It consists of a standard message header, a set of
message types, a set of data types that are often used in messages, and required
routing behavior for clients that implement the P4 protocol.


2.1) Message Overview

There are two primary types of messages: system messages, used to manage the P4
network, and data messages, which contain information to be used by plugins. All
of the message types except DATA are system message types. Currently, the
following messages are defined:


+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Message                           Description                                |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  HELLO       Sent when a client connects to the network. Used to notify       |
|              other clients of the user's address and active plugins.          |
|                                                                               |
|  PING        Used to query the user logged on at a given address. A client    |
|              that receives a PING should respond with a PING-ACK.             |
|                                                                               |
|  PING-ACK    The response to a PING. Includes the name of the user logged     |
|              onto the client that received the PING.                          |
|                                                                               |
|  CONNECT     Opens a P4 network connection. (Connections are two-way.)        |
|                                                                               |
|  DISCOVER    Sent in order to acquire a connection to a new host. This will   |
|              eventually result in a CONNECT message from another host.        |
|                                                                               |
|  LKA         Requests a copy of the LKA table. (See 5.1: LKA)                 |
|                                                                               |
|  LKA-ACK     The response to an LKA message. Includes a copy of the sender's  |
|              LKA table.                                                       |
|                                                                               |
|  DATA        Contains data for a plugin.                                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
            Figure 2.1.1: The P4 message types.


2.2) Connecting and Disconnecting

A P4 client connects to the P4 network by connecting to another client that is
already connected to the network. The method of initially finding a connected
client is not part of the P4 protocol and will not be described here. (Usually,
this is done out-of-band. Clients are encouraged to write a cache of known
client addresses to disk, so that they can use this list to automate the
acquisition of client addresses.)

All communication between clients is done over TCP/IP connections. These may be
long-lived (if initiated with a CONNECT message) or short-lived (if initiated
with most other messages). To send a P4 message, after establishing a TCP
connection to the remote client, the following null-terminated, ASCII-encoded
string should be sent:

P4 CONNECT/<protocol version string>

where <protocol version string> is the ASCII string containing the protocol
version. In this case, it is "0.2" (without quotes). Note that there is no 'v'
character before the version number.

If the remote client supports the given protocol version, then it *must* respond
with the null-terminated, ASCII-encoded string:

P4 OK

If the local client receives this string, then it may then send one of the
messages in Figure 2.1. If the remote client responds with any other string (or
doesn't respond), the connection fails and the local client should close the
TCP/IP connection. Note that the remote client may be a P4 client that does not
implement the specified version of the protocol. If the local client supports
multiple versions, it may try again with another version string.

To disconnect, either side may simply close the TCP/IP connection.


3) MESSAGE HEADER
-----------------

All P4 messages have a standard header. This header includes the message type,
routing and multiplexing information, and the sender's username and signature.
The header has a total length of 56 bytes, most of which is due to the username
and signature. The header is as follows:

    (bit offsets)
    0               8               16                              32
    +---------------+----------------+-------------------------------+
    |      flags    | for future use |           plugin ID           |
    +---------------+----------------+-------------------------------+
    |                            data length                         |
    +----------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                            message ID                          |
    |                            (64 bits)                           |
    +----------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                            \   \               |
    |                    username (20 bytes)     /.../               |
    |                                            \   \               |
    +---------------------------------------------    ---------------+
    |                                            /   /               |
    |                RSA signature (20 bytes)    \...\               |
    |                                            /   /               |
    +--------------------------------------------   -----------------+
    |                            data                                |
    |                                                                |
    |_.-'^`-._.-'^`-._.-'^`-._.-'^`-._.-'^`-._.-'^`-._.-'^`-._.-'^`-.|

            Figure 3.2: Another view of the P4 message header.



Note: All fields in the P4 message header, system messages, and other
data types are sent using network byte order (i.e. big-endian) unless specified
otherwise. Also, all numeric fields are unsigned integers.

Note: All IP addresses sent in P4 messages are in IPv4 format. For example,
the dotted quad 208.17.50.4 is represented with the following four bytes:

    +--------+--------+--------+--------+
    |  0xD0  |  0x11  |  0x32  |  0x04  |
    +--------+--------+--------+--------+
      byte 1   byte 2   byte 3   byte 4

    Figure 3.3: An IP address in IPv4 format.



The fields in the message header are described as follows (the length of the
field is given in parentheses after the name):

    flags (1)

The flags field contains eight significant bits, one for each message type and a
couple for other options. The flags are:

+---------------------+
|  Flag       Bitmask |
+---------------------+
|  CONNECT     0x01   |
|  HELLO       0x02   |
|  PING        0x04   |
|  DISCOVER    0x08   |
|  LKA         0x10   |
|  DATA        0x20   |
|  ENCRYPTED   0x40   |
|  BROADCAST   0x80   |
+---------------------+
Figure 3.4: The flags.


The CONNECT, HELLO, PING, DISCOVER, LKA, and DATA flags signify the type of the
message. Only one of these flags may be set at a time. The ENCRYPTED flag
signifies that the data is encrypted with the sender's private key using RSA
encryption. The ENCRYPTED flag may only be set if the DATA flag is set. The
BROADCAST flag signifies that the message should be broadcast to all clients
that the recipient is connected to (except the sender). The BROADCAST flag may
not be set with any of the CONNECT, PING, DISCOVER, or LKA flags. It must be set
with the HELLO flag, and may optionally be set with the DATA flag.


    for future use (1)

This byte is currently unused. It may be used in future versions of the
protocol.

NOTE: The following is of historical interest only.

This field used to be a hops-to-live field. The hops-to-live field was set by
the sender and decremented once by each recipient. If a client received a
message with hops-to-live set to 0, that message would *not* be forwarded. The
only messages that required use of the hops-to-live field were HELLO, DISCOVER,
and any message with BROADCAST set.

The hops-to-live field was removed because it was redundant. The message ID
field, together with a correct implementation of the protocol, should prevent
loops. (See 6: Message Routing and Behavior)


    plugin ID (2)

The plugin ID is an identifier that is unique to a plugin. It is used to
multiplex DATA messages from (or to) different plugins running on the same
client. (See 7.2: Plugin ID Management)

NOTE: A side effect of this is that no more than one instance of a given plugin
may be running on a P4 client at any time.


    data length (4)

The length of the data (not including the header), in bytes. This means that the
beginning of the next header can be located by adding the data length to the
end of the current header.


    message ID (8)

The message ID is a numeric identifier for this specific message that is
(hopefully) unique on the network for at least 10 minutes. The message ID of a
BROADCAST message is stored by every client who receives it. If a client
receives a BROADCAST message with a previously seen message ID, the message
should be dropped (and not forwarded). Implementations of this protocol should
use a collision-resistant PRNG to generate the message ID so that inadvertent
collisions are minimized.


    username (20)

The username of the user who originally sent the message. This field *must* be
null-terminated, so the effective maximum length for usernames is 19 letters.


    RSA signature (20)

The RSA digital signature of the message header, excluding the signature field,
under the sender's private key. More precisely, the message to be signed is the
header, starting with the flags field and ending with the username field. The
sender should ensure that the signature verifies with the public key for the
username in the header, as this is how other clients will verify the signature.


    data (variable length)

The message's data is stored here. This may be data for a plugin, network data,
or empty depending on the message type. The length of the data is given in the
data length field. Note that the data length field is 4 bytes, so the upper
bound on the size of the data is 4GB.


4) MESSAGE TYPES
----------------

Each of the message types is described below, along with its usage and data
format (if any). The length of the message's data is given in parentheses after
the message name. If a message does have data, it must be formatted according to
the specifications below. The data is placed in the data segment of a standard
P4 message, i.e. immediately after the P4 message header. There are are no gaps
or padding bytes in the P4 data stream.


4.1) HELLO (variable)

(byte offsets)
0          3 4    5 6            7 8          29 30         51
+-----------+------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| source IP | port | plugin count | plugin info | plugin info | ...
+-----------+------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
    Figure 4.1.1: HELLO data format.

    source IP (4)
The IP address of the sender.

    port (2)
The port that the sender's P4 client is bound to.

    plugin count (2)
The number of plugins that are active on this client. This must be the number
of plugin info fields that are added to the end of this message.

    plugin info (22)
A field with information about plugins that are active on this client. (See 5.2:
Plugin Info)

The HELLO message is used to notify all clients on the network that a user has
logged on. When a user starts a P4 client and logs on, the client sends a HELLO
message as soon as it establishes a connection with another client (see 4.4:
CONNECT). When a client receives a HELLO, it adds the sender to its LKA and
forwards the HELLO to all of its other connected clients.

The HELLO message is also sent when a user starts or stops an active plugin, so
that the active plugin information for that client is up-to-date.

The HELLO message is always sent through the P4 network. If a client receives
a HELLO message without the BROADCAST flag set, the message is invalid and the
client should close the connection.

If a client receives a HELLO message for a username that already exists in the
LKA, the entry is updated. (There may not be multiple entries in the LKA with
the same username.) If a user is logged on from one computer, and then logs on
from a different computer, the HELLO message from the second computer will
replace the LKA entry from the first computer. From then on, messages sent to
that user will be sent to the second computer and not the first computer.
However, the client on the first computer is *not* explicitly disconnected from
the network. However, this may be provided for in future versions of the
protocol.

NOTE: If a client sees more than one name for the same plugin ID, the client's
behavior is undefined. However, a client may *not* have two plugins installed
with the same plugin ID.


4.2) PING (no data)

The PING message is used to query which user is logged into the P4 network at a
given IP address. Usually, it is used to verify that a user in the LKA table is
still connected at the address cached with their username. When a client
receives a PING, they must respond with a PING-ACK.

The PING message has no data. It is always sent directly to a client, outside of
the P4 network. If a client receives a PING message with the BROADCAST flag set,
the message is invalid and the client should close the connection.


4.3) PING-ACK (no data)

The PING-ACK message is sent in response to a PING message. When a client
receives a PING-ACK message and the username in the PING-ACK is different from
the username in the LKA table, it should update the username in its LKA table.
NOTE: If this happens, the new user's HELLO packet must still be circulating
in the network. Otherwise, the shared state is inconsistent.

The PING-ACK message has no data. It is always sent directly to a client,
outside of the P4 network. If a client receives a PING-ACK message with the
BROADCAST flag set, the message is invalid and the client should close the
connection.


4.4) CONNECT (no data)

The CONNECT message is used to open a (semi-)permanent connection with another
client. When a client sends a CONNECT message, it should add the recipient to its
connection list. When a client receives a CONNECT message, it must add the sender
to its connection list.

A client may not refuse a connection request. Also, unless the client program is
exiting, it may not close an open connection unless the connection has been open
for at least 30 seconds. This makes the bootstrap process more likely to
succeed. If a client can only find the address of one other connected client,
this ensure that it can open a connection to that client and send DISCOVER
messages regardless of how busy the other client is.

A client should make a reasonable effort to keep its connection list populated,
but not over-populated. No requirements are made, but it is suggested that the
average size of the connection list be kept somewhere between 4 and 12 clients.

The CONNECT message has no data. It is always sent directly to a client, outside
of the P4 network. If a client receives a CONNECT message with the BROADCAST
flag set, the message is invalid and the client should close the connection.


4.5) DISCOVER (6)

(byte offsets)
0          19
+------------+
|  username  |
+------------+
Figure 4.5.1: DISCOVER data format.

	username (20)
The username of the user who originally sent the DISCOVER message. Since this
user must have sent a HELLO message, they should have an entry in the LKA, which
we can use to get their IP address and port.

The DISCOVER message is used to find another client on the network to open a
connection to. When a client receives a DISCOVER message, it must either forward
the message to a random client from its connection list or send a CONNECT
message to the DISCOVER message's sender. It should forward the DISCOVER with
probability 9/10 and respond with a CONNECT with probability 1/10.

NOTE: There is a possible refinement to this algorithm. Clients could forward a
DISCOVER with probability relative to their number of connections.
Well-connected clients could forward the DISCOVER more often than poorly
connected clients. This may be specified in future versions of the protocol.
However, it may not be easy to allow this kind of flexibility between
implementations while still enforcing a reasonable response rate.

NOTE: Clients may disconnect from the network while holding a DISCOVER message,
so a client that sends a DISCOVER message is not guaranteed to have a connection
opened to them as a result.

The DISCOVER message is always sent inside the P4 network, but it is not
broadcast. If a client receives a DISCOVER message with the BROADCAST flag set,
or from a client that is not in its connection list, the message is invalid and
the client should close the connection.


4.6) LKA (no data)

The LKA message is used to request a copy of the current LKA. A client should
only send an LKA message to a client in its connection list. When a client
receives an LKA message, it must respond with an LKA-ACK message containing its
current LKA table.

NOTE: The LKA table that is returned in the LKA-ACK is only *loosely* current,
because it is likely that there are still HELLO messages circulating in the
network.

The LKA message has no data. It is always sent inside the P4 network, but it is
not broadcast and not forwarded. If a client receives a LKA message with the
BROADCAST flag set, or from a client that is not in its connection list, the
message is invalid and the client should close the connection.


4.7) LKA-ACK (variable)

(byte offsets)
0          3 4
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| LKA size  | LKA entry | LKA entry | ...
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
    Figure 4.1.1: LKA data format.

    LKA size (4)
The number of users in the LKA table. This must be the same as the number of LKA
entry fields that are added to the end of this message.

    LKA entry (variable)
An entry in the LKA table. (See 5.1: LKA)

The LKA-ACK message is sent in response to an LKA message. The LKA-ACK must
contain a copy of the sender's current LKA table in the correct format. (See
5.1: LKA)

The LKA-ACK message is always sent inside the P4 network, but it is not
broadcast and not forwarded. If a client receives a LKA-ACK message with the
BROADCAST flag set, or from a client that is not in its connection list, the
message is invalid and the client should close the connection.


4.8) DATA (variable)

The DATA message is used to send data from a plugin to a plugin. The plugin that
should receive the message is designated by the plugin ID in the P4 message
header. Plugins are not restricted to sending data only to the same type of
plugin. A plugin may send data to another type of plugin, either in the same
client or a different client, by passing the destination plugin's ID to the API
Send or Broadcast function. For this to be successful, the source plugin should
format its message according to the destination plugin's message protocol.

Either one or both of the BROADCAST and ENCRYPTED flags may be used with the
DATA message. If the BROADCAST flag is set, a client that receives a DATA
message must forward it to all of its other connected clients. If the ENCRYPTED
flag is set, the sender's client must encrypt the data with the sending user's
private RSA key, and the recipient's client must decrypt it with the sending
user's public RSA key. Encryption is done at the platform level.


5) Other Types

There are two complex data types that are sent within P4 messages. These are the
LKA entry type and the plugin info type. They are described below.


5.1) LKA

Each client should maintain an LKA table, or Last Known Address table, that
stores each known username and the last address and port where they were known
to be logged in. This should be the last address that this user sent a HELLO
message from. The details of this table are not specified in the protocol, and
are left up to each implementation. However, some of the information in this
table is sent over the network in the LKA-ACK message, which includes the number
of entries in the table and each entry in a specific format. This is the format
of the LKA entry field:

(byte offsets)
0         19 20     23 24  25 26         27 28       29 30       31
+-----------+---------+------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
| username  | IP addr | port |plugin count | plugin ID | plugin ID | ...
+-----------+---------+------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
    Figure 5.1.1: The format of an LKA entry.

    username (20)
The username of this LKA entry.

    IP addr (4)
The last IP address where this user was known to be logged in.

    port (4)
The last port this user was known to be logged in on.

    plugin count (2)
The number of plugins that are active on this client. This must be the number of
plugin ID fields that are added to the end of this LKA entry.

    plugin ID (2)
The plugin ID of a plugin that is active on this client.


5.2) Plugin Info

When a client connects to the P4 network, it must send a HELLO message with
information about each of the plugins that are active. The information for each
plugin is sent in a plugin info record. This is the format of the plugin info
record:

(byte offsets)
0          1 
+-----------+
| plugin ID |
+-----------+
Figure 5.2.1: The plugin info format.

    plugin ID (2)
The plugin ID.


NOTE: The following is of historical interest only.

The plugin info record originally held the plugin ID and the plugin name.
However, the plugin name field was unnecessary, since plugin ID <-> name
mappings are assumed to be well-known, and not provided by P4. (See 7.2: Plugin
ID Management)

The plugin name field was an ANSI character string and was null-terminated, so
the effective maximum length of plugin names was 19 letters.


6) Message Routing and Behavior

This section describes the routing behavior that a P4 client must adhere to.

- A client may not refuse a connection request.
- Unless a client program is exiting, it may not close an open connection unless
the connection has been open for at least 30 seconds.
- A client that receives a HELLO must add the originator's username, IP address,
  and port to its LKA table.
- A client that receives a PING must respond with an PING-ACK.
- If a client receives a PING-ACK with a different username than the username
  stored in the LKA table for the source IP address, the client must replace the
  old username in the LKA table with the username in the PING-ACK.
- A client that receives an LKA must respond with an LKA-ACK.
- If a client receives a BROADCAST message, it must forward the message to all
  connected clients except the client it received the message from. However, if
  it has seen a message with the same message ID in the previous 10 minutes, it
  may *not* forward the message. (This is a lower bound on the time to remember
  previously seen message IDs - clients may remember them longer.)
- If a client decides not to forward a DISCOVER, it must send a CONNECT to the
  originator of the DISCOVER.
- A client must send every DATA message that is queued for sending by a plugin,
  and must pass to each plugin every DATA message that it receives with that
  plugin's ID.
- A client may not modify any message that it forwards.
- A client must fill in the P4 message header completely for any message it
  sends, including the username and RSA signature fields. The fields must be
  correct.

No requirements are placed on the rate at which a client may send messages or
open connections. However, it is in the developer's best interest to place
reasonable safeguards on bandwidth usage and open connections. If a rogue client
is allowed to flood the network, it may become unusable, and less users will use
the system as a whole.


7) Miscellaneous

7.1) PKI

P4 uses public key RSA encryption and digital signatures to perform
authentication and data encryption. Public key encryption is used instead of a
symmetric key cryptosystem (such as Kerberos) because the platform is
user-based, not session- or transaction-based. However, this raises a common
problem: how to do PKI, or Public Key Infrastructure.

P4 does not solve this problem. The P4 protocol does not place any requirements
on how public keys are acquired, so clients may support any reasonable PKI that
accesses the same public key database. Possibilities include a single
Certificate Authority, a hierarchical Certificate Authority tree, or a web of
trust similar to PGP.

TODO: [reference PKI doc here]
For the purposes of CS194, we will implement a stub PKI and support for this PKI
in our client. This is described in another document [reference PKI doc here].
This PKI will be intentionally insecure. However, P4 is designed so that if a
secure PKI is used, then the entire system is secure.


7.2) Plugin ID Management

As with PKI, the P4 protocol does not place any requirements on plugin ID
management. There are also no restrictions on how clients respond to plugin ID
collisions, except that a client may not have two plugins with the same ID
installed. We believe that there will be a low incidence of collisions. When
there are collisions, it is the plugin developers' responsibility to resolve
them.

For the purposes of CS194, we will build a web site with the official,
"sanctioned" list of plugins and IDs. However, clients are not required to
access this list. Furthermore, we provide the list only as a convenience. We
believe that the system can be consistent and self-regulating without such a
list.
