Cat baths

We gave our cats a bath today. It's not exactly an original topic on the
internet - hell, [Cats in Sinks](http://catsinsinks.com/) was our original
example site for [App Engine](https://appengine.google.com/). This time, we
didn't come up with a crazy twist for bathing the cats, or take HDR photography,
or even [add lolcat captions](http://builder.cheezburger.com/Builder). Still,
the pictures do have some good "aww poor kitty!" moments. Enjoy!
