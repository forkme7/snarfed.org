### Musee Mecanique at Pier 45

Last weekend, Becca and I pretended we were San Francisco tourists for a day.
We walked from her apartment to the waterfront, ate clam chowder at
Fisherman's Wharf, wandered through Ghirardelli Square, and crinkled our noses
at the open-air crab market.

We ended up at the [Musee Mecanique](http://museemechanique.org/), a
collection of antique arcade machines and animatronic games. There were early
pinball machines, mechanical baseball and bowling and golf games, silent film
reels, fortune tellers, and entire miniature carnivals filled with mechanical
puppets. It was amazingly cool. What's more, it only cost a quarter or two to
start each one playing or dancing or whirling.

I only wish I knew more about the engineering that went into them. Some of
them sound
[fantastically complex](http://museemechanique.org/7.html).
Damn the world for having so much cool stuff to distract me with!
