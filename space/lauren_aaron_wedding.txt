Lauren and Aaron's Wedding

My cousin
[Lauren Quirk married Aaron Rodriguez](http://couples.weddingchannel.com/wedding_websites/PersonalWebsite.action?view=home&occ=570671021)
in Austin, TX in October 2007. The ceremony was beautiful, star-studded, and
attended by as much of our family as any of our
[family reunions](Family+Reunion+Cruise). Congratulations, Lauren and
Aaron!
