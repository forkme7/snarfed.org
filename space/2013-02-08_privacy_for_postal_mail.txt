Privacy for postal mail

[privacy](privacy_through_prepaid_credit_cards). I recently changed my mailing
address, and it took some research, but I'm pretty happy with the result. Most
of it was straightforward, but there's one small trick that's worth mentioning.

There's lots of existing knowledge on using
[PO boxes](http://blog.invisible-privacy.com/2011/05/how-to-receive-mail-at-po-box-using.html),
[ghost addresses](http://jjluna.com/Ghost-Addresses), and
[CMRAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_mail_receiving_agency)
instead of your home address. (Why not your home address?

[thoughts](http://blog.invisible-privacy.com/2009/04/five-ways-to-keep-your-home-address.html).)

Unfortunately, none of them are ideal. Ghost addresses are good for filling out
forms, but not so good at receiving actual mail. PO boxes are good for mail, but
not packages, and you can't use them for many purposes.

CMRAs are the most promising. They give you a real street address, for a fee,
and receive your mail and packages and optionally forward them. More recently,
many will open your mail (with your permission), scan it, provide access to the
scans online or over email, archiving or shred the physical copies. Very cool.
