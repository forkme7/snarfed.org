Google Holiday Party 2003

Google's holiday party this year was held at the _fabulous_ Computer History
Museum in Mountain View. No, really, it was much more fabulous than I expected.
Fire dancers, two dance floors, great food and open bar(s), phenomenal
decorations, and beautiful people in elegent evening attire. Well, except for us
software engineers.
