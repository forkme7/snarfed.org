ido.el post-command-hook error

If you use [Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs) 23 and
[ido](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings), and you see this
error when you run `ido-switch-buffer`:

> `Error in post-command-hook: (wrong-type-argument sequencep t)`

...you might have an outdated version of `ido.el`. You probably have version
1.56, from 2002, which is included in many Emacs packages. Details on the bug in
[this emacs.bugs thread](http://search.gmane.org/?query=%22Issue+with+ido.el+%28post-command-hook%29%22&author=&group=gmane.emacs.bugs&sort=revdate).

Happily, the bug is fixed in the 
[2009 version of ido.el](http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/emacs/emacs/lisp/ido.el).
Take a look at your Emacs package and see if it has that version, maybe in
`/usr/share/emacs/23.1/site-lisp` or somewhere similar. If not, grab it and put
it somewhere in your path so that it takes precedence over your package's old
version. Happy editing!
