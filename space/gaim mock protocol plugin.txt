Mockprpl (formerly nullprpl) is a mock protocol plugin for
[gaim](http://gaim.sf.net/). You can create accounts with it, sign on and off,
add buddies, and send and receive IMs, all without connecting to a server!

Beyond that basic functionality, mockprpl supports presence and away/available
messages, offline messages, user info, typing notification, privacy
allow/block lists, chat rooms, whispering, room lists, and protocol icons and
emblems. Notable missing features are file transfer and account registration
and authentication.

Mockprpl is intended as an example of how to write a gaim protocol plugin. It
doesn't contain networking code or an event loop, but it does demonstrate how
to use [gaim's API](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/api/files.html) to do pretty
much everything a prpl might need to do.

Mockprpl is also a useful tool for hacking on gaim itself. It's a
full-featured protocol plugin, but doesn't depend on an external server, so
it's a quick and easy way to exercise gaim and test new code. It also allows
you to work on gaim [while you're
disconnected](https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=9534285).

Mockprpl requires [Gaim](http://gaim.sf.net/) 2.x and
[libtool](http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html) 1.4 or higher (on
\*nix) or [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/)/[MinGW](http://mingw.org/) (on
Windows). It may work with Gaim 1.x, but no promises. Windows support was
generously contributed by [Andrew Hart](http://sourceforge.net/users/arhart/).

Mockprpl was formerly known as nullprpl. For posterity, you can still
[download nullprpl-0.2.tar.bz2](/space/nullprpl-0.2.tar.bz2).
