The

is up!

I speak at small events here and there [pretty regularly](/space/talks), and
many of them take video recordings, so normally, this wouldn't be a big deal.

However, not many of them publish the videos, much less in
[such an accessible format](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srOgpXECblk),
so that's always exciting. I also put a little more effort into this talk, and I
definitely had a lot of fun with it.

Enjoy!
