[Knightsquire](http://www.mobygames.com/game/knightsquire) is a charming little
game from indie developer Buloght. It's disappeared from its
[original page](http://www.bigbluecup.com/games.php?action=detail&id=753), so
so I'm posting this to point people toward the
[mirror](http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/knightsquire/full-game/11835.html),
hosted by
[StrategyInformer](http://www.strategyinformer.com/).
If it ever disappears from there, I'll host it here.

A glowing
[review](http://adventuregamers.com/article/id,736/bulog) on
[AdventureGamers](http://adventuregamers.com/) spurred me to check it out, but
when I followed its link, I found that its
["official" page](http://www.bigbluecup.com/games.php?action=detail&id=753)
had been removed without explanation. :(

It took some digging to find the
[mirror](http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/knightsquire/full-game/11835.html).
[Googling for it](http://www.google.com/search?q=knightsquire) turned up lots
of reviews and other pages, but almost all of them point to the official page.
The StrategyInformer page was buried pretty far down in the search results.
