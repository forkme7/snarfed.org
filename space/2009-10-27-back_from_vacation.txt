I'm back from [vacation](/space/2009-10-09_vacation)! Paris, Barcelona, and the
south of France have been great, especially since they were all new to me. I'm
looking forward to posting thoughts and pictures over the next few days.

I definitely have lots of highlights and memorable moments to share. As with
[past](/space/2006-09-14) [trips](/space/2007-12-01_windsurfing_in_venezuela),
though, don't expect anything in depth, any broad conclusions, or even any
segues between the random thoughts.

In the meantime, it's good to be back. I loved the trip, but it definitely made
me grateful for little things here like healthy food, my regular exercise regimen,
and showers I actually fit in.
