For the impatient:  
&nbsp; Download [comments\_openid.py](/space/comments_openid.py)  
&nbsp; Download [Python OpenID libraries](http://www.openidenabled.com/python-openid/)  
&nbsp; [Download contrib pack 1.3.3](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=67445&package_id=145140&release_id=489295) (includes AJAX support)

[comments\_openid.py](/space/comments_openid.py) is a
[PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.sf.net/) plugin that allows
[OpenID](http://openid.net/)-authenticated comments. When used in conjunction
with the
[comments plugin](http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/registry/input/comments/comments),
it allows people to comment on your PyBlosxom-based site
using their OpenID provider. In addition, if their provider supports the
[Simple Registration Extension](http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/simple-registration-extension),
it displays their nickname instead of their OpenID URL under the comment.

To use it, first download the
[Python OpenID libraries](http://www.openidenabled.com/python-openid/)
Then, download [comments\_openid.py](/space/comments_openid.py) and
place it in your plugins directory. 

Then, add this line to your flavour's head template:

    <link rel="openid.server"
          href="$base_url$openid_trigger">

If you want to use SSL, hard-code your base url, like so:

    <link rel="openid.server"
          href="https://snarfed.org$openid_trigger">

Finally, add the `openid_password` (required) and `openid_trigger` (optional)
config variables to your `config.py`:

    py['openid_password'] = 'topsecret!'
    py['openid_trigger'] = '/openid'

Et voila! You should be good to go. Try it out on a friendly neighborhood
OpenID-enabled blog near you, like maybe
[Scott Kveton](http://kveton.com/blog/)'s.

You can also provide your name, email address, and other information to sites
that you log into with OpenID, using the
[Simple Registration
Extension](http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/simple-registration-extension).
Just fill in any of these config variables in `config.py`:

    py['openid_nickname'] = 'ryan'
    py['openid_email'] = 'ryan'
    py['openid_fullname'] = 'Ryan Barrett'
    py['openid_dob'] = '1901-01-01'
    py['openid_gender'] = 'M'
    py['openid_postcode'] = '90001'
    py['openid_country'] = 'US'
    py['openid_language'] = 'EN-us'
    py['openid_timezone'] = 'America/Los_Angeles'

Default HTML is included for the endpoint, login, and error pages. For your
CSS styling pleasure, it uses divs with the classes `openid-info`,
`openid-login`, and `openid-error`.

You can override the default HTML by adding `openid-info`, `openid-login`, and
`openid-error` templates for your flavour of choice. Example templates for the
html flavour are included in
[openid_server-0.3.tar.gz](/space/openid_server-0.3.tar.gz).
