### An Epic Weekend ![/space/coat_small.jpg](/space/coat_small.jpg)

OK, I know it's Friday - well, technically Saturday - , and I'm just now getting
around to posting about what I did last weekend. It was an epic weekend. Don't
worry, though, I didn't write an epic poem about it...[just a rather long
post.](/space/Maulik's_Epic_Visit)
