webalizer referrer spam blacklist

[Referrer
spam](http://www.spywareinfo.com/articles/referer_spam/) - or by Apache's
original misspelling, _referer_ spam - has been a problem at snarfed.org for
years. My [webalizer logs](http://ryan.barrett.name/usage/) are publicly
accessible, so spammers target this site with fake referrers, hoping that
they'll be linked from the pages that
[webalizer](http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/) generates.

There are a number of approaches to fighting referrer spam, but so far, no
silver bullet. I currently handle it a hand-edited blacklist of known spammer's
sites. It's far from ideal, but it works. You can find my blacklist in my
[webalizer.conf](http://ryan.barrett.name/webalizer.conf) file. If you're
fighting referrer spam too, feel free to borrow it.

Eventually, I'd like to merge this with other blacklists and referrer spam
tools, such as [Jay Allen's](http://www.jayallen.org/)
[MT-Blacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/). For now, though, one step
at a time.
