I like to keep track of some the things I do. Naturally, there are
[pictures](/space/pictures) and
[past posts](/space/archive)
from this site, but there are plenty of other lists too.

For food and drink, there's
[chocolate](/space/chocolate),
[friday mexican dinner](/space/friday+mexican+dinner),
[beer](/space/beer), and
[wine](/space/wine).
For media, there's
[books](/space/books),
[games](/space/games),
[feeds](/space/feeds),
[podcasts](/space/podcasts),
[movies](/space/movies), and
[tv](/space/tv).
And for things I create instead of consume, check out
[talks](/space/talks),
[software](/space/software), and
[writing](/space/writing).

Check out [lists](/space/lists) for the full, uh...list!
