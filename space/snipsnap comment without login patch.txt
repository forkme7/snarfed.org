[SnipSnap 1.0b2-uttoxeter
source](ftp://snipsnap.org/snipsnap/snipsnap-1.0b2-uttoxeter-20050204-src.tgz)  
[Ant](http://ant.apache.org) (needed to build SnipSnap)

I use [SnipSnap](/space/SnipSnap) as the web server for this site, and I love
it. However, my single biggest gripe with SnipSnap is that it requires you to
register before you can comment.

I want to do everything possible to encourage people to comment. If they have to
jump through the account creation hoops for yet another site before they can
comment, chances are they won't. So, I wrote a [patch](/space/snipsnap-comment-without-login.patch) to allow visitors to
comment without logging in.

It's running on this site right now. [Try it!](/comments/snipsnap comment without login patch#post)

The patch applies cleanly against [SnipSnap
1.0b2-uttoxeter](ftp://snipsnap.org/snipsnap/snipsnap-1.0b2-uttoxeter-20050204-src.tgz).
To use it with an existing SnipSnap installation, download the [SnipSnap
source](ftp://snipsnap.org/snipsnap/snipsnap-1.0b2-uttoxeter-20050204-src.tgz),
apply the patch, and build SnipSnap with [Ant](http://ant.apache.org). Then copy
the newly rebuilt snipsnap.jar into your SnipSnap's lib/ subdirectory, and copy
snipsnap-servlets.jar into your application's WEB-INF/lib/ subdirectory, over
the existing jars. Restart SnipSnap and you should be good to go!
