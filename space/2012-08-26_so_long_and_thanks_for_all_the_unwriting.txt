So long, and thanks for all the unwriting

<img class="right" src="locked_diary.jpg" />

This [unwriting thing](2012-08-11_unwriting) has been an interesting little
experiment. It started with a backlog of iffy ideas that I wasn't sure about,
but also couldn't bring myself to toss, so I decided to throw them up here as
quick-and-dirty as possible. I didn't have grand intentions, nor did I expect
much from the results. If I got them out of my head, that would be enough.

That's how it started, at least. If you're reading this, you know they ended up
a bit more than quick-and-dirty. I didn't put quite as much effort into them as
usual, but I came close. They're a good impression of my normal posts. The main
difference was that I wrote them a lot faster.

Looking back on it, I don't know if that's a good thing. I'm

I'm pretty sure the unwriting posts came in below average. Not unacceptably so - I
really am happy with some of them - but overall, meh.

Still, I'm glad I wrote them. I write mostly for myself, using this site like an
overblown diary. I post in public more for the discipline it forces on me, and
as an obligatory nod to public discourse and sharing information, than for
readership or acknowledgment. Sure, I get that
[endorphin boost](http://sundial.csun.edu/2011/08/social-networking-sites-creates-high-for-users/)
from comments and likes, just like everyone, but it's secondary at best.
Otherwise, I'd spend a lot less time
[waxing philosophical](2012-08-15_if_theres_no_free_will_then_what) and a lot
more time posting [crazy pictures of myself](2012-08-20_hello_anaphylaxis).

Did I learn any valuable lessons from unwriting? I'm not sure. I could claim
that it reinforced the value of practice,
[a la Malcolm Gladwell](http://www.gladwell.com/outliers/index.html), but
practice only helps when it's paired with evaluation, feedback, and adjustment.
I didn't do much of that while I was unwriting.

Maybe the only benefit is that I enjoyed the process, and I'm happy with the
results, if not as writing I'm proud of then as [a personal account](index) of
things I'm currently thinking about. Measured against that yardstick, this a
better, more complete diary for including the unwriting posts. Maybe that's
enough.
