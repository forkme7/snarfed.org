Technology makes us more who we are

_This is part of my [Unwriting series](2012-08-11_unwriting), which means it's
rough and probably not worth reading. If anything, skim it._

"Technology isn't inherently good or evil, it's just a tool." We've all heard
this before. We may quibble over individual cases, but most of us agree that it
has at least a core of truth. I wonder if there's a related corollary:
"Technology doesn't change us, it just makes us more who we already are."

We have it pretty good today. Centuries ago, in the bad old days, life was
tough. You worked long hours of manual labor, cared for sick children for months
at a time (and counted your blessings if they survived), and dodged tax
collectors and priests and soldiers who made your life miserable. When by some
miracle you had a free minute, you sewed new clothes to replace the ones that
were literally crumbling off of your back. Your time was not your own.

Life is better now. It's not distributed equally - many people are still in
awful straits - but average quality of life and disposable time and income have
skyrocketed, thanks largely to two things: trade and technology.

[Matt Ridley argues for trade](http://www.rationaloptimist.com/) better than I
ever could. As for technology, "better living through science" may be just as
familar as "technology is just a tool." During the early 20th century,
periodicals like
[Good Housekeeping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Housekeeping) stuffed
their pages with ads for
[labor-saving devices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homemaking#Household_tools),
promising to transform overtaxed housewives' chores with the press of a button.

Sure, they overpromised a bit. We still have to wash clothes and dishes, clean
around the house, and fix things when they break. That array of devices and
services did delivered some serious time savings. We may spend more and more of
it working - especially since two working parents is the norm now, instead of
one - but that's often by choice, since many of us are salaried and don't earn
overtime.

What's more, beyond free time, technology also freed up mental energy that we
would have otherwise spent on those needs. What do we do with those extra brain
cycles? We read books, play sports, watch movies, play music, debate politics,
cultivate friendships, and write rambling blog posts like this.

Those activities are all pretty damn high on
[Maslow's hierarchy of needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs),
way higher than fighting off yet another disease or sewing yet another pair of
pants. More to the point, they're things we _choose_ to do, not things we have
to do to survive, so they're much better reflections of our personalities.

I think about this every time I post an essay here, or
[start a new hobby](2012-04-11_meditation), or jump through
[ridiculous hoops](privacy_through_prepaid_credit_cards) so I can keep being
[weird about privacy](2011-08-03_why_im_weird_about_privacy). I'm incredibly
grateful that my standard of life (and yours, if you're reading this) allows me
to pursue the things that make me who I am. I suspect I have technology to thank.
