For the impatient:  
[Download tackon.dll](/space/tackon.dll)

[tackon.dll](/space/tackon.dll) is a plugin for
[NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/), the scriptable Windows installer from
[Nullsoft](http://nullsoft.com/). It allows you to "tack on" and later retrieve
an arbitrary amount of data from an NSIS installer package.

Tackon was written by the developers of [Blogtorrent](http://blogtorrent.com/),
a [Downhill Battle](http://downhillbattle.org/) project. Tackon is distributed
as part of the Blogtorrent source code.

A [mingw](http://mingw.org/) Makefile is provided for building tackon, but
installing mingw on Windows can be downright painful. Even installing on Linux
takes a little effort. So, I'm hosting the [tackon.dll
binary](/space/tackon.dll) here for those who'd like to hack on NSIS
and/or Blogtorrent, but would like to skip the hassle of building tackon
themselves.
