Yesterday, I finally got the chance to hear a
[symphony performance](http://wdch.laphil.com/tix/performance_detail.cfm?id=2851)
at the
[Walt Disney Concert Hall](http://wdch.laphil.com/about/overview.cfm).

It's a striking building. It's not easy to describe, but it brings to mind a
spaceship from the future. Sleek, curved, asymmetrical, and metallic: as with the
[Bilbao Guggenheim](http://www.guggenheim-bilbao.es/ingles/home.htm),
[Gehry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry)'s style is unmistakeable.

The interior was a departure, though. It was surprisingly warm, filled with
bright hardwood and lush carpet. I wanted to sit down, put my feet up by the
fire, and listen to Grandpa spin a yarn.

The
[performance itself](http://wdch.laphil.com/tix/performance_detail.cfm?id=2851)
didn't quite measure up to the building, but it wasn't bad.
[Heléné Grimaud](http://www.helenegrimaud.com/)
joined
[Ashkenazy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Ashkenazy) and the
[NHK](http://www.nhkso.or.jp/en/profile.html) during the first half for
Brahms' _Piano Concerto No. 1_. Despite her theatrics at the piano, she was
magnificent. I'd never heard the concerto in person before, and it's amazingly
powerful.

On its own, though, the NHK was a little lacking. They're too...deliberate.
They worked so hard to play the notes, and they were so proud when they did,
that the music itself fell by the wayside. They made up for it with technical
pyrotechnics and sheer volume, but they didn't have much dynamic range.
Debussy's _La Mer_ was noticeably slower than usual, and felt labored when it
should have been light and airy.

Despite their heavy hand, though, we all recognized Elgar's main theme
in _Enigma Variations_. The piece was new to us, though, so it took us a
while to realize that it had been
[featured prominently](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_Variations#References_in_other_music)
in - of all places - the
[_Matrix_ soundtrack](http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/matrix.html).
We got a kick out of that.
