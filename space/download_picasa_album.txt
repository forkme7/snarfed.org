[download_picasa_album.sh](/space/download_picasa_album.sh) is a simple little
shell script that downloads entire photo albums from
[Picasa Web](http://picasaweb.google.com/). Just give it the album's RSS feed,
and it will parse the feed, extract the links to the full-size pictures, and
download them one by one. For example:

    $ ./download_picasa_album.sh 'http://picasaweb.google.com/...&alt=rss'
        % Total    % Received % Xferd   Speed   Time    Time  
                                       Upload   Total   Spent 
      100 74442    0 74442    0     0      0 --:--:--  0:00:03
      ...
 
This script is dirt simple. If you're looking for something robust and
full-featured, you probably want an
[RSS reader that supports enclosures](http://http://www.podcastingnews.com/topics/Podcast_Software.html)
or a
[dedicated web photo downloader](http://www.google.com/search?q=web+photo+downloader)
instead. Personally, I have a small brain, so tiny shell scripts like this are
just right for me.

[download_picasa_album.sh](/space/download_picasa_album.sh) should work on most
*nix-based systems. It uses [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/),
[grep](http://gnu.org/software/grep/), [sed](http://gnu.org/software/sed/), and
xargs, which should come with your distribution.
