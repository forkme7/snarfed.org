_Updated 3/22/2007._

For privacy reasons, I use
[prepaid debit cards](/space/privacy+through+prepaid+credit+cards) instead of
credit cards. Right now, I mostly use
[Simon gift cards](http://www.simon.com/giftcard/).

Like most prepaid card web sites,
[Simon's](http://www.simon.com/giftcard/card_balance.aspx) can show your
card's balance and transaction history in real time. However, it's a little
tedious to navigate the site and enter the card number and CCV over and over.
So, I automated it.

[simonitor.sh](/space/simonitor.sh) is a shell script that fetches the
available balance, expiration date, and address (if registered) for one or more
[Simon gift cards](http://www.simon.com/giftcard/). It uses
[curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) to POST each card number and CCV to [Simon's web
site](http://www.simon.com/), then handles the cookies, follows links, and
screen scrapes the resulting HTML.

Here's an example run:

    $ simonitor.sh 9999012345789/123 8888012345789/456
    99990123456789/123: $232.67, expires 08/2008
                        Mountain View, CA 94043
    88880123456789/456: $39.91, expires 12/2008
    $

I briefly considered writing a [Greasemonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/)
script, but I have a small brain, and the shell script was simpler and didn't
need a browser.
