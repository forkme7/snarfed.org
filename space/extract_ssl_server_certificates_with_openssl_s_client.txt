Ever need to troubleshoot SSL connectivity against a server that you don't own?
No problem! Use the [s_client](http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/s_client.html)
command line tool that comes with [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/).

It negotiates an SSL connection, step by step, and prints debugging info in
excruciating detail. It also includes a dump of the server-side SSL certificate
in PEM format. You can use that certificate to test offline, import into your
client-side keystore, or anything else.

For example, say you're troubleshooting a connection to
[https://example.com/](https://example.com/). You can use this (\*nix) command
line to connect on port 443 and examine the SSL handshake and server-side
certificate:

    openssl s_client -connect example.com:443

Happy authenticating!
