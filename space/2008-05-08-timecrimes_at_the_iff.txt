I don't live in San Francisco, so it took me a while before I finally
made it up there for this year's
[International Film Festival](http://fest08.sffs.org/about/).
I saw the Spanish film
[Timecrimes](http://fest08.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=85)
aka Los cronocr√≠menes, by Nacho Vigalondo, at the
[Clay Theatre](http://www.landmarktheatres.com/market/SanFrancisco/ClayTheatre.htm).
I had no idea what to expect, but it turned out to be entertaining, thought
provoking, and a lot of fun.

Similar to [Primer](http://primermovie.com/story.html),
Timecrimes is a take on how ordinary people might handle time travel. I
won't try to reproduce the
[synopsis](http://fest08.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=85) here; suffice
it to say, it was darker _and_ funnier than any time travel movie I'd seen
before. If you get the chance, see it!

I'm not much of a film buff, so I won't try to to comment on the
[festival itself](http://fest08.sffs.org/films/) or the
[San Francisco Film Society](http://sffs.org/), which hosts it.
[Cynthia saw](http://originalcynk.com/blog/?p=63) lots of the other IFF movies
this year, so I'll defer to her. I'll have to go to more of the festival next
year!

Thanks to Raj and
