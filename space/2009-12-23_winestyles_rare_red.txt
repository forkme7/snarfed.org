Everyone loves a good urban myth, right? Well, I had a [wine](/space/wine) at
a holiday party last weekend that definitely qualifies, and I'm itching to
find out the true story.

I heard the rumor before I tried the wine. A friend had heard from a contact
at [WineStyles](http://www.winestylesstore.com/), in West Portal, that a high
end winery had called recently with a problem. "We have, well, kind of a cash
flow issue," they'd said, "and we need some help. Can we sell you some good
stuff under the table? You can't say it's ours, but you can put your house
label on it, or whatever. It'll sell."

I don't know why all the secrecy - taxes, contracts with distributors, public
relations - but it made for a great story. More importantly, the wine itself
was fantastic. The label said only "Rare Red," without appelation or vintage,
and the description on the back was totally inscrutable.

We went to WineStyles the next day, hoping to buy a case, but it had sold out.
The people there commiserated, but claimed they didn't know where it had come
from either, only that word had spread like wildfire.

Internet searches have turned up an online Australian store, 
[winestyle](http://www.winestyleonline.com.au/),
with a similar
[Rare Red house label](http://www.winestyleonline.com.au/catalog.aspx?cid=84&c=Rare%20Reds&CurrentPage=0&SortBy=SortByDefault),
but as far as I can tell, they're unrelated. Does anyone know the real
story? If you do, I'll happily buy you a bottle or three!
