In the course of setting up our web sites, [snarfed.org](http://snarfed.org/)
and [maulik.net](http://maulik.freeshell.net/Miki.pl?page=home.miki),
[Maulik](Maulik) and I have written a number of macros for SnipSnap. To
install and use these macros, [download
snarfed.jar](snarfed.jar), put it in your SnipSnap
application's WEB-INF/lib/ subdirectory, and restart SnipSnap.

The included macros are:

  * **IndexSome**, which takes a list of snip paths as its content, and displays
an index with only those snips and their immediate children.

  * **MakeAlbum**, which creates a picture album (with thumbnails, forward and
backward links, etc.) out of a set of pictures.

  * **AlbumPic**, which generates a thumbnail and links to a given snip. This is
useful if you want more flexibility to design your own picture album. It's
similar to the [snipscale](http://snipsnap.org/space/scaled-image) macro.

  * **CurrentUser**, which shows the username of the current user, or "guest" if
the user is not logged in.

  * **Attach**, which attaches a file to a snip.

  * **ShowAttachments**, which shows all of a snip's attachments as links to the
attachment files.

  * **Utility**, which provides miscellaneous code that might be of interest to
macro writers.

The snarfed macros require [SnipSnap
1.0b1](http://snipsnap.org/space/snipsnap-download) or greater, and is
