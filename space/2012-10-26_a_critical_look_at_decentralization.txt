A critical look at decentralization

<img class="right" src="stylized_cloud.jpg" />

Hey federated social web people! I read a great paper yesterday:
[A Critical Look at Decentralized Personal Data Architectures](http://33bits.org/2012/02/21/a-critical-look-at-decentralized-personal-data-architectures/).
If you're working in this space, you should check it out. It's a quick read,
just five pages.

It comes from some pretty high powered authors, including
[Helen Nissenbaum](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/) and
[Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/). They step back and look
objectively at accepted wisdom in our community, such as "people should own
their data" and "decentralized and open always win out," and attempt to
reconcile with the fact that centralized social networks have exploded, but
long-standing decentralized alternatives like [OStatus](http://ostatus.org/)
have not.

Everyone wears rose colored glasses occasionally, including our own community,
but we shouldn't overindulge them. The network effect, ie "all my friends are on
Facebook," isn't the only adoption hurdle. There are real technical, economic,
and product drawbacks to decentralized social networks, and they matter to
users.

I'm fond of the [Indie Web movement](http://indiewebcamp.com/why), which
encourages us to
[focus on the positives](http://indiewebcamp.com/2012/Positive_Arguments) and
evangelize [having your own web site](/2012-07-25_why_i_have_my_own_web_site).
However, we should be honest about the negatives. That's the first step toward
allaying FUD, talking openly about the tradeoffs, and maybe even solving some of
the real problems.

If you've already read the paper, any thoughts?
