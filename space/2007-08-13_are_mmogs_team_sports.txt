Are MMOGs Team Sports?

I love games. I love game development, gaming culture, games as an art form,
and the game industry. I don't have much time to
[play them](http://snarfed.org/space/games), though, so my firsthand
gaming experience has developed massive gaps.

MMOGs, for example. I've never really played them. So when
I found myself talking with
[a friend and coworker](http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Eitrigg&n=Olwen)
who plays [WoW](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/), I jumped at the
chance to pump his brain.

He plays with a [high-level raiding guild](http://www.weknow.to/), so he
spends most of his time in large group raids, 10 to 25 people at a time. I was
fascinated to hear how much teamwork the raids often require. Each person has
a specific role, and each one is vital to the group as a whole. The group
members all support and depend on each other, coordinating tactics with
split-second timing at critical moments.

Granted, FPSes and RTSes have always demanded skills like these, and most
offter multiplayer modes. Competitive team games like
[Counter-Strike](http://counter-strike.net/) and the
[Battlefield series](http://battlefield.ea.com/) have established tournaments,
and leagues like the [CPL](http://www.thecpl.com/) and the
[CGS](http://www.thecgs.com/) have turned the best teams into professional
organizations with serious training regimens. Top Counter-Strike teams
run drills on tactics, study their opponents' game recordings, and
keep extra team members on hand for target practice.

I'd never considered MMOGs in the same vein, though. My friend plays ice
hockey as well as WoW (friend: 1, stereotype: 0), so I asked him what he
thought of the team sport analogy. He saw the parallels, but he saw just as
many differences.

For one, he described his hockey team as more tight-knight and consistent than
his WoW guild. He plays hockey with more or less the same people every week,
barring the occasional absence. His WoW guild is much bigger and looser by
comparison. His raiding group one night might only have a few people in common
with the next night's group.

He also mentioned the immersion factor. Even high-level WoW raids don't always
require his full attention. Whether it's his girlfriend (friend: 2,
stereotype: 0), his phone, or his
[dog](http://flickr.com/photos/mbostock/sets/72157594287115788/), real life
can interrupt WoW much more easily. Interestingly, he said his team's adoption
of [TeamSpeak](http://www.goteamspeak.com/), both added _and_ detracted from
the game's immersion. The always-on voice communication made his team's
presence much more immediate, but it also exposed him to many of his
teammates' interruptions.

OK, so even in large group raids with a top-tier guild, WoW might not always
rise to the level of good hockey game. Still, it's far beyond the grinding,
socializing, and gold farming that the rest of us, the uninitiated, usually
associate with MMOGs. That alone was enlightening.

Personally, I think this speaks to untapped potential of games as an art form.
In the traditional art forms - film, literature, music - the basic consumption
experience doesn't change much. In a game, though, the interactivity means the
basic experience can vary widely. The team sport experience is just one of
many. There's problem solving, socializing, creation, storytelling,
strategizing, role playing, and - my personal favorite - exploration.

So far, the game industry has taken only half-hearted steps toward fulfilling
this potential. It's spent the bulk of its effort iterating old the same tired
themes: racing, fighting, shooting, sports, and adventure. Recently, though,
we've seen the rise of more unusual themes.
[Socializing](http://thesims.ea.com/), for one.
[Music](http://www.guitarherogame.com/),
[medicine](http://www.atlus.com/trauma_center/), and
[law](http://www.capcom.com/phoenixwright/), to name a few others.
[Emotion](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=136645717206489131) may well
be next.

Personally, I think this is awesome. Microsoft, are you listening? Sony?
EA? Activision? Bring on the new experiences, and I'll fork over the dough. I
can't wait, and I know I'm not alone.
