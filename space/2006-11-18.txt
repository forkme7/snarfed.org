I've come down with a pretty bad case of
[RSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury). It's awful.
I'm taking it seriously, so I'm cutting out most non-work-related typing for a
while, including email, IM, [side projects](/space/software), and posting here.

I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do with myself. Please, for the
love of god, wish me a speedy recovery!
