[download_smugmug_album.sh](https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/master/download_smugmug_album.sh)
is a simple little shell script that downloads entire photo albums from
[SmugMug](http://smugmug.com/). Just give it the username and album ID and it
will download the album's feed, extract the links to the full-size pictures, and
download them one by one.

For example:

    $ ./download_smugmug_album.sh foo 123456_XXyyZZ
        % Total    % Received % Xferd   Speed   Time    Time  
                                       Upload   Total   Spent 
      100 74442    0 74442    0     0      0 --:--:--  0:00:03
      ...

To find the username and album ID, look at a SmugMug URL for the album. For
example, in `http://foo.smugmug.com/Bar/Baz/123456_XXyyZZ#!i=...`,
the username is `foo` and the album ID is `123456_XXyyZZ`.

This script is dirt simple. If you're looking for something robust and
full-featured, you probably want an
[RSS reader that supports enclosures](http://http://www.podcastingnews.com/topics/Podcast_Software.html)
or a
[dedicated web photo downloader](http://www.google.com/search?q=web+photo+downloader)
instead.

[This blog comment](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2010/04/fuck-smugmug/#comment-4708)
was useful in writing this script. I also initially looked at
[smugget](https://github.com/realityforge/housekeeping-scripts/blob/master/smugmug/smugget.sh),
but it requires an account. SmugMug supposedly supports anonymous login with any
account's username, but I didn't manage to figure that out.

This script is in the public domain.
