_update: i've taken the buttons off the main page temporarily. design-wise, they
were doing more harm than good. anyway, for posterity, they're here:
[buttons](buttons)_

check out the new buttons on the left side panel. the light blue one is just a
link to [SnipSnap](http://snipsnap.org/), which is the software that runs this
site. but the globe one is very very cool - it uses [GeoUrl](http://geourl.org/)
to show you other web sites that are physically near me. so right now, it will
show other stanford sites, but when i move up to sf, it will show sites near my
apartment. [try
it!](http://geourl.org/near/alt.html?p=&lat=37.42&lon=-122.16&dist=6)
