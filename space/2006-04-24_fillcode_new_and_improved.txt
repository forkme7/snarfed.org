Fillcode, new and improved!

[Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/) is great, but one of my pet peeves is
that while it can fill (ie wrap) plain text, it [can't fill source
code](filling_code_in_emacs). A while back, I wrote
[fillcode](fillcode), an Emacs minor mode that does just that.

Since I started writing more C++ at work, I noticed a few fillcode bugs that
happen often in cc-mode. Specifically, fillcode occasionally gets too excited
and fill more than just the current line. Also, it doesn't always handle
multi-line comments well.

I've posted a [new version](fillcode) that fixes these bugs. _Update,
April 25. I've fixed yet another bug and posted [another new
version](fillcode), 0.5._

Happy filling!
