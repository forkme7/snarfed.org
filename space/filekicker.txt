[Filekicker](/space/filekicker.py) is a [PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.sf.net/)
plugin that serves static files. The file to serve is determined by the URL
path and the `datadir` configuration option. The MIME type is inferred from the
file's extension.

For example, if `datadir` is set in `config.py` like so:

    py['config'] = '/home/ryanb/www'

and the user requests this url:

    http://mysite.org/videos/shovelglove.mov

filekicker will send `/home/ryanb/www/videos/shovelglove.mov` to the client,
if it exists, with the MIME type `video/quicktime`. If it doesn't exist,
filekicker will let pyblosxom handle the request.

Filekicker is different from, but related to, plugins such as
[pystaticfile](http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/registry/files/pystaticfile),
[pyinclude](http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/registry/include/pyinclude),
and
[imagekicker](http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/registry/display/graphics/imagekicker).
It's basically a generalization of imagekicker, which inspired its name.
