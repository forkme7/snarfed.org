resize google calendar

I use paper for my personal calendar, but at work, I use
[Google Calendar](http://calendar.google.com/).
Despite being a web app, and not a rich client, it's really nice...even if I am
a little biased. :P

However, as much as other people complained about [Oracle
Calendar](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/ocal/), our old calendar,
it still beat Google Calendar in one regard.

Google Calendar resizes itself automatically to the browser window. That's
nice, but it means you can't have a window showing _just_ your calendar,
without the navigation widgets on the left.

I keep my calendar open all the time, in a small window off to the side, and I
usually only want to see my agenda for the day. For all its flaws, Oracle
Calendar did let me do that.

So, I set out to make Google Calendar do it too. Luckily, I use
[Firefox](http://getfirefox.com/). After some quality time with the [DOM
Inspector](http://kb.mozillazine.org/DOM_Inspector), I ended up with these CSS
rules in my [userContent.css](http://www.mozilla.org/unix/customizing.html)
file:

    div#mainbody {
      width: 450px !important;
    }
    
    div#gridcontainer {
      height: 370px !important;  
    }

Add them to yours, restart Firefox, load up your calendar, and you should be
able to resize and scroll the window so that only your actual calendar is
visible. Tweak the width and height to your liking!
