Last sunday, I went to
[Planet Granite](http://www.planetgranite.com/)
[in the Presidio](http://www.planetgranite.com/locations/sanfrancisco/sf_hoursanddirections.php)
and did some indoor rock climbing with 
[Cynthia](http://originalcynk.com/blog/),
[Clara](http://www.thefacebookera.com/about.php), and
[Dan](http://www.facebook.com/daniel.s.chao)
I'd climbed lightly a few times before over the years, but apart from a
few short sessions at the
[Stanford climbing gym](http://climbing.stanford.edu/),
this was the first time I'd ever done anything serious.

The safety procedures for climbing and belaying aren't too involved, but they're
involved enough that I needed a refresher course, which Dan was happy to
provide. He prepared me well for the quick, hands-on safety exam in the gym
itself. $24 later, I was harnessed, tied in, clipped on, and climbing up a wall!

I have to admit,, I didn't enjoy that first route much. I'd learned how to tie
knots and handle carabiners, but I didn't really know how to climb, so I had to
learn on the job, which wasn't too fun at first. On top of that, it wasn't the
aerobic or restistance workout I'd hoped for, but my fingers and toes complained
bitterly at the abuse. To top it all off, the height gave me solid dose of
vertigo.

I managed, though, and I saw how I _could_ enjoy it, even if I wasn't actually
enjoying it quite yet. I belayed Dan, then tried another route. And another.
It eventually came together, and before long I was having a great time.

By the end of the day, I'd climbed routes
[rated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_%28climbing%29#YDS_Class)
from 5.7 up to 5.10a, which was evidently a decent showing. I even managed to
["send"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_climbing_terms#Send)
a few of the 5.9s, ie climb them without falling or weighting the rope. I
fell off the 5.10a once, but I still climbed back on and finished it
afterward.

It was a lot of fun. It never really turned into a workout like running or
lifting, and my fingers did turn into claws for a while, but it was definitely
worth it. I started to feel my center of gravity and learned a few moves and
techniques, and I'm looking forward to trying again next week. See you on the
wall!
