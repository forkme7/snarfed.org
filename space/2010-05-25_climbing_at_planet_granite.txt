Last sunday, I went to
[Planet Granite]()
in the Presidio and did some indoor rock climbing with 
[Cynthia](http://originalcynk.com/blog/),
[Clara](http://www.thefacebookera.com/about.php), and
[Dan](http://www.facebook.com/daniel.s.chao)
I'd done some lighter climbing here and there over the years, but apart from a
few short sessions at the
[Stanford climbing gym](),
this was the first time I'd ever done anything serious.

There's not too much safety technique or procedures for climbing and belaying,
but there's just enough that I needed a refresher course, which Dan was happy to
provide. A quick hands-on safety exam and $24 later, I was harnessed, tied in,
clipped on, and climbing up a wall!

I have to admit, though, I didn't enjoy that first route much. I'd learned how
to tie knots and handle carabiners, but I didn't really know how to climb, so I
was learning on the job, which wasn't too fun at first. It wasn't really much of
an aerobic or restistance workout, which I'd hoped for too, but my fingers and
toes complained bitterly at the abuse they'd taken. To top it all off, the
height gave me solid dose of vertigo.

I managed ok, though, and I saw how I _could_ enjoy it, even if I hadn't quite
yet. So, I belayed Dan, then tried another. And another. After a couple more, it
came together, and I was having a great time.

By the end of the day, I'd climbed routes
[rated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_%28climbing%29#YDS_Class)
from 5.7 all the way up to
5.10a, which was evidently a decent showing. I managed to
["send"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_climbing_terms#Send)
a few of the 5.9s, ie climb them without falling or weighting the rope. I
fell off the 5.10a once, but only once, and I climbed back on and finished it
afterward.
