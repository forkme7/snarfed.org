Religious people are happier. Why?

Studies seem to show, all things equal, that
[religious people are happier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_happiness)
than non-religious people. This is called, among other things, the God dividend.
It's a contentious idea, and the literature isn't unanimous, but that just makes
it even more interesting. Is it really true? And if so, why?

First, the research.
http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2012/04/12/religion-makes-people-happierbut-why
Large [survey studies](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-06077-010) and
[public opinion polls](http://books.google.com/books?id=uoD1Ly9CeRAC)
consistenly find strong correlations between religius commitment and
self-reported happiness, measured wellness (e.g. hypertension and
[depression](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-06077-010)), and life
outcomes (e.g. substance abuse, personal relationships, and
[volunteering and philanthropy](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/data_access/data/datasets/social_capital_community_survey.html)).

The conclusions aren't all positive. Religion doesn't correlate with happiness
[at the country level](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-06077-010), and the
happiness link may only hold up in places that
[already value religion](http://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/04/are-religious-people-happier-atheists)
or that have
[higher overall stress and violence](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110808170052.htm).
Methodology is also difficult at best, especially with slippery subjects like
religion and happiness. Noisy data, correlation vs causation, confounding
variables, self selection bias, and all sorts of other problems abound.

Beyond the concrete research, many of us are preconditioned to think ill of
religion. We see its worst fringes in fundamentalists and extremists, read
loudly anti-religion thinkers like [Richard Dawkins](http://richarddawkins.net/)
and [Christopher Hitchens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens),
and conclude that religion must be harmful and dangerous.

Still, there's been a steady stream of statistically significant evidence over
the years, out of enough different sources and methods, that it's probably not a
fluke. On to the really interesting question, then: why? What is it about
religion that makes people happier and generally better off?

One theory is that churches tend to foster strong interpersonal relationships,
which directly contribute to happiness. There's
[some data](http://news.discovery.com/human/religion-happiness-social-bonds.html)
to back this up, too. Sounds reasonable to me.

Another theory is that religious people feel more [spiritual fulfillment and
enlightenment](http://books.google.com/books?id=-o5QEchPo8AC). This sounds less
likely, at least to me. I definitely see the spirituality link, but I'm not
convinced that religion itself correlates all that highly with spiritual
fulfillment, whether true or self-reported."Spiritual but not religious" is
itself a fast-growing religion these days, and churches of many faiths
traditionally emphasize community, values, and behavior over the mental or
physical sensations of spirituality.

Another theory is that religion
[reduces uncertainty](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765557545/Religious-people-are-happier-studies-show.html?pg=all)
in many parts of life, big and small, and uncertainty gradually erodes mental
wellbeing from the inside out. Can I fudge my taxes a bit? Should I tell that
white lie? What's my purpose in life? What will happen to me when I die? Life is
full of questions like these without obvious answers, and short on authoritative
answers.

Religion fills that void, providing not just a list of answers but a mental
framework for addressing entire categories of questions, as well as a concrete
direction to aim for when evaluating life decisions.

(Incidentally, my favorite factoid from researching this post is that while
atheists aren't as happy as religious people,
[agnostics are the most unhappy](http://books.google.com/books?id=C6IQAQAAIAAJ&q=agnostics#search_anchor)
of them all. Maybe ruthless skepticism isn't all it's cracked up to be!)

I wonder if there's another reason, though, one I haven't found in the
literature: the familiar refrain that "it's in God's hands." You may not have
heard it if you don't hang out with religious people much, but it's a common
refrain, especially among Christians.

Like uncertainty, one of the biggest causes of stress is worrying about things
that are out of your control. It's hard to avoid, though. Most things that
affect our lives _are_ out of our control. Religious people have a secret weapon
in God, though. They regularly accept a lack of control by attributing it to God
instead, freeing themselves from the anchor of worry that might otherwise drag
them down.

I can almost empathize, in a way. I
[don't really believe free will](2012-08-15_if_theres_no_free_will_then_what),
which is liberating in much the same way. If something is more or less
predetermined, I can't change it, so there's no sense in letting it get me down.

counteracted by maybe you don't work as hard on add many things that you should,
so results are worse.maybe vicious cycles because then you have to stick your
had in the "good" sand even farther

takeaway? casual expansion is just a theory, but a logical one, occam's razor style. actionable conclusion? not necessarily find religion, but relax your need for control. link to free will post.
