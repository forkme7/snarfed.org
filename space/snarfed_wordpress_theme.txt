...started to submit it to wordpress's theme directory, jumped through a bunch
of hoops, finally got sick of it and gave up when it asked me to add gravatar

[Download snarfed theme 0.2](snarfed_wordpress_theme.zip)

This site runs on [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) and uses its own
[WordPress theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes), the
aptly named [snarfed theme](snarfed_wordpress_theme.zip).

snarfed is simple, clean, and minimalist. Many standard elements and pieces of
text have been removed, including admin links (edit, manage, etc.) on the live
site. If you really want them, you can add them back by editing `functions.php`
and `style.css`.

snarfed is a [Thematic](http://themeshaper.com/thematic/) child theme, so you'll
need Thematic installed too.

Features:

  * Minimalist aesthetic.

  * Right hand sidebar. Top index widget area, only displayed on the home page.

  * Search via my
    [AJAX site search script](http://snarfed.org/site_search_with_the_google_ajax_search_api).
    See below for configuration.

  * Automatic search for related pages on 404 errors.

  * [OpenID](http://openid.net/) delegation. See below for configuration.

  * New page template, "Posts and Pages," which is an alternative to the built-in
    archive. It [lists pages as well as posts](index).

  * Add last updated time to pages and posts if they've been updated since they
    were first published.

  * Hide the comment form on initial page load. It appears when users click on the
    "Post a comment" link.

  * [NextGEN Gallery](http://alexrabe.de/wordpress-plugins/nextgen-gallery/)
    integration: custom album-compact and imagebrowser templates, styled to be
    consistent with the rest of the site.

  * Link blog title to home page. Link blog description to [/about](about).


Two of the features, AJAX site search and OpenID delegation, need a little extra
configuration. You'll need to define new constants in your wp-config.php. Here's
an example:

    define('OPENID_DELEGATION_PROVIDER',
           'https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/ud?source=profiles');
    define('OPENID_DELEGATION_LOCAL_ID',
           'http://www.google.com/profiles/[USERNAME]);
    define('GOOGLE_AJAX_SEARCH_API_KEY', '[KEY]');


The snarfed WordPress theme is in the public domain.
