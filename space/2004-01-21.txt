### Message of the, um, previous days

On my [personal site](/ryan.barrett.name/), I have a "message of the
day" that i update every now and then. The [old messages of the
day](/ryan.barrett.name/old_motds.html) are archived on the site.

p.s. yes, this post is pretty useless. yes, i mostly did it just so i'd have a
more permanent link to the archive.

p.p.s. i'll put up a more interesting post, probably about [my sister's
art](http://vanessaart.com/), Real Soon Now.
