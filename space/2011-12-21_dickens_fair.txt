Dickens Fair

I had a *great* time at [Dickens Fair](http://dickensfair.com/), the Victorian
England, Christmas themed renaissance faire that's been held every year in San
Francisco since 1970.

It's massive, and the production values are amazing. So many killer details
throughout the whole place, so many great performances! Everything from full-on
stage plays to little interactions with beggars and police and dancing and other
impromptu scenes. It felt like a huge set, complete with real life characters,
that you could walk around inside and touch and interact with. Not to mention
the authentic food, drinks, and craftsmanship in artifacts like quill pens and
pewter goblets you can actually buy.

I'm definitely going back next year!
