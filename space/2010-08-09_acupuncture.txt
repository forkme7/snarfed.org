Acupuncture

Recently, I went to get acupuncture for the first time. I only had a vague idea
of what to expect, but it turned out to be pretty interesting. I'm glad I tried
it.

We were in good hands from the beginning. The acupuncturist we went to, Fu
Yu-Tai, was a [tui-na](http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Atui-na) master in
China with a successful practice before he came to California. His office here
was straightforward and businesslike, but I didn't mind. I was there for the
needles, not the ambience.

He first asked me what was bothering me. I told him nothing in particular, which
confused him a bit, so I recanted and admitted that my neck and shoulders
occasionally get stiff. He started with a massage, which surprised me, then
put in the needles, turned out the lights, and left us to bake for half
an hour. Thank god I brought [podcasts](podcasts) to listen to, since I can't
stand being idle without a choice.

The needles tingled a bit as he inserted them, but otherwise I didn't feel much.
The first time I fidgeted a bit, though, I was blown away. It didn't hurt,
exactly, but it did feel like a two by four had materialized between my shoulder
blade and my back. It was very, very uncomfortable.

I immediately shifted back, and the two by four disappeared. A few minutes later
I fidgeted again, without thinking, and this time an anvil sprouted inside my
neck. Very disconcerting, and like the two by four, very uncomfortable. I
learned my lesson, gingerly turned my head back, and tried hard not to move at
all for the next twenty minutes. I consoled myself with the thought that
[it could be worse](2009-03-13_mri).

As we left, I asked my neck and shoulders how they felt, and they weren't sure.
Maybe better? The results were inconclusive. To Fu Yu-Tai's credit, though, he
did successfully remove the two by four from my shoulder and the anvil from my
neck. Now when I wake up with a hope chest embedded in my back, I know what to
do!

Incidentally, neither
[Google](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=acupuncture+near+3033+clement+st+94121) nor
[Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=acupuncture&ns=1&find_loc=3033+clement+st%2C+94121)
admit to knowing anything about a Yu Tai Acupuncture Clinic at 3033 Clement St.
in San Francisco. If it wasn't for
[Street View](http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/),
I might suspect I dreamt the whole thing.
