It's late notice, but we're going to see [Tim O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/tim/)
speak at [Long Now](http://longnow.org/seminars/) tonight, and we have a couple
extra tickets. The talk is titled
_[Birth of the Global Mind](http://longnow.org/seminars/02012/sep/05/birth-global-mind/)_,
and it's at 7:30 at the
[Cowell Theater](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=%2B37%C2%B0+48%27+31.07%22,+-122%C2%B0+25%27+53.23%22+%28-122.431454,+37.808631%29&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=17&iwloc=addr)
at [Fort Mason](http://www.fortmason.org/). Ping me if you're interested!

I've been a [Long Now Foundation](http://longnow.org/) member for a few years
now, and I really enjoy being part of their community. They think about what it
means to take the very long view - 10,000 years! - and then advocate for and
work on [projects](http://longnow.org/projects/) for that horizon. I tend toward
the long view myself, but they take it to an extreme, and I love watching the
shift in perspective they demand.

See you there!
