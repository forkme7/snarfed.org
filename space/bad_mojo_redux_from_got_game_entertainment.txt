_Executive summary: beware of
[Got Game Entertainment](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/)'s downloadable
games. [Bad Mojo: Redux](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/badmojo/)'s
[DRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) locked me
out, despite the fact that I bought it legimately. Their tech support was slow
and couldn't fix the problem, so I eventually
[fixed it myself](/space/bad_mojo_redux_from_got_game_entertainment#fix). To
their credit, they offered me a refund and a couple free games, but still..._

I love old-school, point-and-click,
[Kings Quest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Quest) style adventure
games. Sadly, they're not mainstream any more, but there are a few smaller,
less established publishers that still specialize in them.
[Got Game Entertainment](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/) is one of them.

Got Game has a
[wide selection](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/games/)
of adventure games for the PC, Mac, and PSP. What's better, they sell many of
them online as direct downloads, including
[Bad Mojo: Redux](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/badmojo/), which I'd
been looking for for a while. As soon as I saw it, I plunked down my
[prepaid credit card](/space/privacy+through+prepaid+credit+cards),
downloaded it, fired it up, and played it happily for an hour or so.

When I came back a couple days later, it complained _"Bad Mojo CD not present
in drive C"_ and refused to start. I
[searched Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22bad+mojo%22+%22cd+not+present%22)
and found other people with the same problem, but no solution.

I emailed Got Game's tech support, and over a week and a couple follow-up
emails later, they finally responded. They asked a few basic questions, over
the course of a couple more weeks, and finally told me that they _didn't know_
what the problem was! Disappointed, I asked for a refund, since I couldn't
play the game. They finally agreed, but it took them a while.

I don't like bad-mouthing Got Game publicly. I'd much prefer to support and
encourage companies that sell adventure games. It's clear that Got Game is a
small, independent outfit, and founder
[Howard Horowitz](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12312)
is
[well-intentioned](http://www.justadventure.com/Interviews/HowardHorowitz/Horowitz.shtm)
and
[passionate](http://www.fourfatchicks.com/Rants/Interviews/Howard_Horowitz/HH.shtml)
about adventure games. I can't help being a little disgruntled, though.

<a name="fix"></a>

Anyway, here's the fix. Bad Mojo uses the `badmojo.ini` file to determine
where it's installed. By default, it looks for the file in its own directory,
e.g. <nobr>`C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\\`</nobr>. However, if a `badmojo.ini`
file exists in `C:\Windows\\`, it uses that instead.

In my case, the Bad Mojo installer put an incomplete `badmojo.ini` file into
`C:\Windows\\`. It had only these lines:

    [badmojo]
    Preferences=1111110
    [SoundMix]
    SoundOn=1
    DumbSound=0

I copied these lines from <nobr>`C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\badmojo.ini`</nobr>
into it, and voila, no more error!

    [BOOGER]
    BACKGROUND=C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\OVER;C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\BACKGND
    TOPO=C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\TOPO
    BTC=C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\BTC
    PALETTE=C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\PALETTE
    SCRIBBLE=C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\OVER;C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\SCRIBBLE
    CEL=C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\OVER;C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\CEL
    SCRIPT=C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\SCRIPT
    ROACH=C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\ROACHD
    MOVIE=C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\OVER;C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\MOVIE
    MASH=C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\OVER;C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\MASH
    SOUND=C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\SOUND
    SAVE=C:\Program Files\Bad Mojo\SAVE
    USER=Ryan

Alternatively, deleting `C:\Windows\badmojo.ini` also fixes the problem.
