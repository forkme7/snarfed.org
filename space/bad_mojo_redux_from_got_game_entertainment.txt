_Executive summary: don't buy
[Bad Mojo: Redux](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/badmojo/) from
[Got Game Entertainment](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/). Their
[DRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) has locked me
out of the game, despite the fact that I bought it legimately, and they
haven't provided a fix or refunded my money._

I love old-school, point-and-click,
[Kings Quest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Quest) style adventure
games. Sadly, they're not mainstream any more, but there are a few smaller,
less established publishers that still specialize in them.
[Got Game Entertainment](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/) is one of them.

Got Game has a
[wide selection](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/games/)
of adventure games for the PC, Mac, and PSP. What's better, they sell many of
them online as direct downloads, including
[Bad Mojo: Redux](http://www.gotgameentertainment.com/badmojo/), which I'd
been looking for for a while. As soon as I saw it, I plunked down my
([prepaid](/space/privacy+through+prepaid+credit+cards)) credit card,
downloaded it, fired it up, and played happily for an hour or so.

When I came back a couple days later, it complained _"Bad Mojo CD not present
in drive C"_ and refused to start. I
[searched Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22BAD+mojo%22+%22cd+not+present%22)
and found other people with the same problem, but no solution.

I emailed Got Game's tech support, and over a week and a couple follow-up
emails later, they finally responded. They asked a few basic questions, over
the course of a couple more weeks, and finally told me that they _didn't know_
what the problem was! Disappointed, I asked for a refund, since I couldn't
play the game. I haven't heard from them since, nor have I received a refund.

I don't like bad-mouthing Got Game publicly. I'd much prefer to support and
encourage companies that sell adventure games. It's clear that Got Game is a
small, independent outfit, and founder
[Howard Horowitz](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12312)
is
[well-intentioned](www.justadventure.com/Interviews/HowardHorowitz/Horowitz.shtm)
and
[passionate](http://www.fourfatchicks.com/Rants/Interviews/Howard_Horowitz/HH.shtml)
about adventure games. I can't help being disgruntled, though, that Got Game
sold me a game I can't play, and they won't provide a fix or a refund.
