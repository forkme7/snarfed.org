Instead of the standard clubbing in SF or bar-hopping in Palo Alto,
[Maulik](http://maulik.net/) and I headed down to Saratoga last night for
[Bollywood Nights](http://rdproduction.com/bollywoodnights02042006.html) at
[Avalon](http://www.nightclubavalon.com/). Oddly, the club is smack in the
middle of a strip mall, deep in the heart of valley suburban sprawl. Somehow,
though, it worked.

When we got there, the parking lot was packed and the line stretched all the way
around the building. Many were there for [DJ
Megha](http://us.rediff.com/news/2003/aug/25india-1.htm), who'd come from Mumbai
for the party. The crowd was very chic, very energized, and very desi. Out of
over a thousand people, I was one of maybe ten non-desis. :P

Regardless, it was way more fun than I normally have clubbing. Outside of a few
smaller communities, the mainstream clubbing and dancing scene tends to be very
self-conscious. This, on the other hand, was a lot less inhibited...and a lot
more fun. It reminded me of
[Mela](http://www.stanforddaily.com/tempo?page=content&id=11249&repository=0001_article),
[Diwali](http://daily.stanford.edu/tempo?page=content&id=12231&repository=0001_article),
and [Bhangra by the
Bay](http://www.stanforddaily.com/tempo?page=content&id=2234&repository=0001_article) - and their afterparties - at Stanford.

Granted, I don't know much bhangra, raas, or filmi...but I do know just enough
to be dangerous. Most of the crowd was just amused that a 6'5" white guy even
_tried_ to dance to Bollywood music. Regardless, they were all really friendly
and inclusive. It was a great party.
