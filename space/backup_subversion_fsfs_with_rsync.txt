I use
[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) for source control, and it's great.
I recently migrated my repository to use the new
[FSFS](http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/notes/fsfs) backing store, which
stores the repository directly on the filesystem, instead of in
[Berkeley DB](http://sleepycat.com/).

One of the many advantages of FSFS is that it's very easy to backup. The
repository files can be copied directly. The only tricks are to copy the
db/current file first, and not to copy the transactions/ directory. I backup my
repository with rsync, like so:

    rsync ... /path/to/repo/db/current backup:~/repo/db
    rsync ... --exclude transactions/ --exclude db/current \
              /path/to/repo backup:~/
