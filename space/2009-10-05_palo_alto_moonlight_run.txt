As I've [mentioned here before](/space/2006-02-01_running_maps), I don't usually need much
structure around exercising. I love running, lifting, and playing sports with
friends, but I'm generally more inclined to just throw shoes on and go
running, or grab someone and play tennis, than sign up for anything organized.

Still, I do run the occasional
[race](/space/2006-05-24_bay_to_breakers),
[triathlon](/space/2008-08-23_triathlon), or
[other odd event](/space/2006-03-05_bollywood_nights) now and then...like
last Friday. [Steve](http://www.facebook.com/stgarrity) and I ran the 10k at the
[Palo Alto Moonlight Run](http://www.paloaltoonline.com/moonlight_run/).

We had [Friday dinner](/space/friday_mexican_dinner) early, right before the
race, so we were unfortunately full of chips, chimichangas, and margaritas.
What's more, neither of us trained much. Steve doesn't need to - a 10k run is
a light day for him - but it's definitely farther than my average run, and I
don't even run every day.

Still, we pushed hard, just to see what we could do, and we managed to finish
in [under 47 minutes](http://changeofpace.com/Results/MLR09/10KOVER.TXT). That
put us at roughly 7:30 mile pace, which I was more than happy with. It's also
nice to have a benchmark like this, since I track progress and measure
performance so rarely.

I don't know that I'll run races any more than I do now, but they're
definitely fun every now and then. Thanks, Steve!
