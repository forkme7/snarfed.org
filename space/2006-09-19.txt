### The Wire, and the rest

It premiered a couple weeks ago, but I didn't get the chance to watch the
season premiere of [The Wire](http://hbo.com/thewire/) until last night. It
was good, as always, and it sets up a season that promises greatness, nothing
less.

The Wire is easily the best TV show I've ever seen. It lives up to the HBO
legacy of deep, complex, nuanced dramas that unfold slowly over the course of
an entire season. The Wire foregoes eye candy and witty repartee for realism,
subtlety, and unparalleled writing and acting. It's less TV than modern
literature. And I don't even work for HBO's marketing department. :P

I also caught the season premieres of
[The Amazing Race](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race5/),
which was silly but fun, and
[Studio 60](http://www.nbc.com/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip/),
which was surprisingly good. Think
[Entourage](http://hbo.com/entourage/) meets
[West Wing](http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/) -
not surprising, since Studio 60 is also written by the
[embattled](http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/20321/)
Aaron Sorkin. Also, props to NBC, you can
[watch the entire episode online](http://www.nbc.com/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip/).

Thanks to Matt and Kristin for their living room and company, and to
the [Tim Goodman](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/indexn?blogid=24) for his
