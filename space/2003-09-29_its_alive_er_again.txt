It's alive...er...again.

Yeah, so [http://snarfed.org/](http://snarfed.org/) has been up, down, up again,
sideways, fallen over, and turned upside down in the last few weeks. It's
finally back up. I can't guarantee that it will be up permanently, much less
five nines or six sigma or whatever your buzzword of choice is...but it's up
now. That counts for something, right?
