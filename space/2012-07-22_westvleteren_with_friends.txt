I recently acquired some of the fabled
[Westvleteren 12](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westvleteren_Brewery#International_reputation),
the Belgian Trappist beer widely regarded as the best in the world. They usually
only sell it in person at their monastery in Belgium, but thanks to my good
friend eBay, I managed to grab some of the recent
[limited run](http://trappist-beers.com/monks-decide-to-export-70-000-boxes-with-special-westvleteren-12-version/)
they sent to distributors to raise money for a big renovation.

Beer is better with friends, like most things in life, so I dragged a few people
over to the house to try it with me. We primed our palates with beer from other
classic Belgian monasteries like [Duvel](http://www.duvel.be/),
[Rochefort](http://users.pandora.be/gerritvdb/rochefort/English/RochefortIndex.htm),
[Orval](http://www.orval.be/an/FS_an.html), [Malheur](http://www.malheur.be/),
and [St. Bernardus](http://www.sintbernardus.be/en/), as well as a handful of
pretenders to the throne from [Ommegang](http://www.ommegang.com/) and
[The Bruery](http://www.thebruery.com/).

We started with tripels and golden ales, then moved into ambers, dubbels, and
quads before finally trying the Westvleteren. It was great, as expected. The
competition was stiff, so it didn't blow us away, but everyone agreed it was
damn good, even when compared to all the other very good beers.

We finished off with a few more unusual brews: The Bruery's
[White Oak](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/16866/51069), a wheat-based
barleywine partly aged in bourbon barrels; [Malheur](http://www.malheur.be/)'s
[Brut Noir](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/669/16487), a
[champagne beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_in_Belgium#Champagne_beers);
and [Ommegang](http://www.ommegang.com/)'s
[Seduction](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/42/76521), a porter style ale
made with cocoa nibs. The White Oak came highly recommended by Trafton at
[City Beer](http://www.citybeerstore.com/), who helped me find beers that could
stand up to the Westy. Thanks Trafton, and thanks to everyone who came. Great
afternoon, great beer, great company!
