generate_blogpost.sh

I use [Stuart Rackham](http://srackham.wordpress.com/)'s
[blogpost.py](http://srackham.wordpress.com/blogpost-readme/)
to publish my pages and posts to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/).
It's great!

Unfortunately, when I [migrated to WordPress](2010-08-08_migrated_to_wordpress),
I imported lots of existing posts and pages that I also wanted to be able to
update with blogpost.py. So, I wrote a script to generate the `.blogpost` files
for those posts and pages: [generate_blogpost.sh](generate_blogpost).

The script isn't too complicated. It just fetches all existing pages and posts
from MySQL, finds the corresponding `.txt` files in the working directory, and
generates corresponding `.blogpost` files using the post ids, types, titles, and
permalinks stored in the database.

To run it, simply pass the same parameters you'd pass to `mysql`, e.g.

    $ ./generate_blogpost.sh -h [HOST] -u [USER] [DATABASE]

Tested with blogpost.py version 0.9.3.
