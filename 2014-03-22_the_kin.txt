[The Kin](http://www.thekin.com/) are killing it at [Party Corps](http://www.partycorps.org/)' [Music for Good concert](https://www.facebook.com/events/1449015715331215/) tonight! As expected, they've spent more time playing off stage than on it. Charisma and stage presence for days. It's amazing how strong and rich a sound they produce from a single acoustic guitar, two voices, and a keychain against a clipboard (no joke).
