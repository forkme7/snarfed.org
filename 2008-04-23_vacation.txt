The last couple months have been eventful, to say the least, so I'm happy to say
that I'm taking a vacation. With any luck, my only decisions on a day to day
basis will be which hiking trail to explore, which deck to sit and read on, and
[which chocolate](/chocolate) to eat after lunch.

I don't plan to check personal mail regularly, and I don't plan to check work
mail at all, so if you don't get a reply, that's probably why. See you in a
couple weeks!
