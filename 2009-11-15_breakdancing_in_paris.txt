On our last night in [Paris](/2009-10-28_paris) on [vacation](/2009-10-27_back_from_vacation), [Jeremy](http://www.facebook.com/cotter) and I hung out with a break dancing troupe and watched them perform on the streets near Plaza St. Michelle. They were great athletes, great performers, and a lot of fun.

Jeremy posted videos the other day. [Check](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJI2L95JZc0) [them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3rOyeuzVAI) [out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgnlcLp4AzI)!
