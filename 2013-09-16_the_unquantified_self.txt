The unquantified self

One of my favorite runs is the
[Mayfield Slough loop](http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/fullscreen/411912/), which
winds through the heart of the wetlands above Shoreline Amphitheatre. It's often
deserted at sunset, devoid of anything man-made, and the bruised light makes the
marsh land bridges feel haunted, desolate, post-apocalyptic. It's a hell of an
escape, one I've never quite been able to reproduce.

I tried tracking it with a pedometer and GPS once, and I hated it. I fiddled
with the gadgets, distracted myself with my trail on the map, chided myself for
slow splits and basked smugly in fast ones. I did pretty much everything
_except_ immerse myself in the flow of running and the beauty of the place and
time.

A decade ago, I loved tracking myself. Call it what you want - quantified self,
personal analytics, lifelogging - I was on board. I
[logged everything I did](/bigbrother) for years, slicing and
dicing and generating lots of
[charts and graphs](/ryan.barrett.name/bigbrother/). I didn't
have a specific goal, just the usual "track stuff because I can!" engineer
mentality, but it was still fun.

I've been off the bus for a while now. As conversations with my friends fill
with [Fitbits](http://www.fitbit.com/) and [Withings](http://withings.com/) and
[UPs](https://jawbone.com/up), and hacker acquaintances put together
[entire personal APIs](http://x.naveen.com/post/51808692792/a-personal-api),
I've developed an allergy to tracking myself. At this point, I'm enough of an
unknown quantity that I'm pleasantly surprised to be alive at all.

Why? It's not [the privacy thing](/2011-08-03_why_im_weird_about_privacy). I'm
pretty [happy with my life](/2012-08-14_streamlined_life), so I don't think it's
fear of the unknown. I'm definitely not unwilling or unable; I've
[spent my career](/resume) building and running large software systems and
stressing about metrics.

Part of it is that I'm not ambitious, or competitive, or
[hungry](http://hungryentrepreneurs.com/). If you are, I can see how tracking
works for you, but not me. I enjoy learning new skills, but I don't like
overanalyzing the process. Outside of work, nothing turns me off faster than
measuring things or crunching numbers.

It's more than personality. I treasured the sensation of that sunset run - I
still do - and tracking killed it. I only checked the stats and screens
occasionally, but it didn't matter. Just knowing the data was flowing was enough
to pull me out of flow and the joy of the trail.

[Attention](/2013-05-31_fighting-information-overload-and-beyond#context-switches)
and [mental energy](/2012-08-25_not_whether_you_agree_but_how_much_you_care) are
largely zero sum games. You can improve them over time, but in the moment,
thinking about one thing means you're not thinking about something else. We're
already saddled with petty brains that prefer to worry about our kids' next
report card, or the zinger we should have delivered in yesterday's meeting, than
what's going on in front of us. _Be here now_ and _live in the moment_ are
cliches for a reason. Therapists don't often say, "You're too outwardly focused.
Dwell on your own issues more!"

At the same time, compelling experiences in the real world are fleeting, easy to
spoil or miss altogether. Just showing up isn't enough; you have to be open
minded, paying attention, ready and willing to jump in with both feet. We all
know that checking Twitter on our phones doesn't cut it, and for me, tracking
causes the same problem. I'm there physically, but my head is only half in the
game. The other half is picturing the bump in my stats and composing the perfect
status message to share them with.

If this sounds like a cliche, I apologize, and I commiserate. Nothing makes me
glaze quite as fast as tired canards like _technology is dehumanizing_,
_smartphones are turning us into zombies_, or _put down the video game and go
outside._ That's not where I'm coming from, promise. Technology and data are
wonderful, powerful tools that empower us in ways we couldn't imagine even
decades ago, and largely still can't. I take full advantage, and I'm grateful.

Still, the usual caveat applies. Tools aren't inherently good and bad, it's how
they're used that matters. I've spent years chest deep in analytics and time
series data, aggregating and trending and anomaly detecting, and I've seen
firsthand how fragile meaning is and how easily it drowns in a flood of numbers.
I know tracking is meant to complement real life experiences, not replace them,
but I wonder if it often does more harm than good. It definitely does for me.

This is the same reason I'm uncomfortable with
_[social first](http://jackealtman.com/socialfirst-the-new-way-to-live)_,
_[pictures or it didn't happen](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pics%20or%20it%20didn%27t%20happen)_,
_[if you didn't blog it, it didn't happen](http://dashes.com/anil/2011/01/if-you-didnt-blog-it-it-didnt-happen.html)_,
and even
_[you can't improve what you don't measure](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/632992-measurement-is-the-first-step-that-leads-to-control-and)_,
at least when we apply them to our personal lives. (Don't get me started on
[Klout](http://klout.com/).)

As usual, smarter people put this more eloquently than I ever could. David
Foster Wallace's
_[This is Water](http://books.google.com/books?id=lfAFVtz-at8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22probably%20the%20most%20dangerous%22&f=false)_
is introspective as usual:

> Probably the most dangerous thing...is my tendency to to over-intellectualize
> stuff, to get lost in abstract thinking instead of simply paying attention to
> what's going on in front of me.

And Jaron Lanier gently chides in
_[You Are Not a Gadget](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6683549-you-are-not-a-gadget)_:

> It is easier to set up a rigid representation of human [life] on digital
> networks...and that reduction of life is what gets broadcast between friends
> all the time. What is communicated between people eventually becomes their
> truth.  
> ...  
> The central mistake of recent digital culture is to chop up a network of
> individuals so finely that you end up with a mush. You then start to care
> about the abstraction...more than the real people who are networked.  
> ...  
> The deep meaning of personhood is being reduced by illusions of bits. Since
> people will be inexorably connecting to one another through computers from
> here on out, we must find an alternative.

I could record that run in full GPS and HD video, track every biomarker and
sensor and timestamp, and I'd still never capture the exhilaration of flying
over a sliver of land bridge through purple water and yellow sky and air so
still I was scared to breathe. Even worse, I'd lose it in the moment. It's not
true for everyone, but if I can't have my cake and eat it too, I choose
experience. As Hamlet would say, there are more things in heaven and earth than
are aggregated in my data.
