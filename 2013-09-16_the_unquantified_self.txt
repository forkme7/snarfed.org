The unquantified self

<p class="right half">

One of my favorite runs is the
[Mayfield Slough loop](http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/fullscreen/411912/), in
the heart of the wetlands just above Shoreline Amphitheatre. I'd run it at
sunset on weekdays, and I'd often go for five or six isolated miles across a
land bridge and along the bay without seeing anyone else. The landscape was
otherworldly, the light bruised and unsettling, and combined with the utter
absence of anything man-made, the overall sensation was hauntingly, desolately,
post-apocalyptically beautiful. It was a hell of an escape, one I've never quite
been able to reproduce.

I tried tracking it with a pedometer and GPS a couple times, and I hated it. I
fiddled with the gadgets, distracted myself with the stats and map trail I was
generating, chided myself for slow times and basked in the self-satisfaction of
a fast split. I did pretty much everything _except_ immerse myself in the flow
of running and the experience of being there, in that place, at that moment.

I used to love tracking myself. Call it what you want - quantified self,
personal analytics, lifelogging - I did it for a while, pretty consistently,
about a decade ago. I [tracked everything I did](http://snarfed.org/bigbrother),
at a high level, and then crunched the numbers and generated
[lots of charts and graphs](http://snarfed.org/ryan.barrett.name/bigbrother/). I
wasn't on any specific mission, just the usual "track stuff because I can!"
engineer thing, but it was still fun.

I've been off the quantified self bus for a while now. As conversations with my
friends have gradually filled with [Fitbits](http://www.fitbit.com/) and
[Withings](http://withings.com/) and [UPs](https://jawbone.com/up) and nearby
hackers put together
[entire personal APIs](http://x.naveen.com/post/51808692792/a-personal-api),
I've developed an allergy to tracking myself. I'm enough of an unknown quantity
at this point that I'm pleasantly surprised to still be alive at all.

I'm still working out my reasons for this. It's not
[the privacy thing](/2011-08-03_why_im_weird_about_privacy). I'm pretty
[happy with my life](/2012-08-14_streamlined_life), so I don't think it's fear
of the unknown. I'm definitely not unwilling or unable; I've
[spent my career](/resume) building and running large software systems and
stressing about uptime and metrics.

Some of it may be that I'm just not ambitious or competitive or
[hungry](http://hungryentrepreneurs.com/) I enjoy learning new skills, but I
don't like analyzing that process. Outside of work, nothing turns me off faster
than measuring things or crunching numbers.

I think there's a bigger factor at play, though. I treasured the feeling that
Mayfield Slough run used to give me - I still do - but when I tracked it, that
feeling disappeared. I only checked the stats and screens occasionally, but it
didn't matter. Just knowing the data was flowing in the background was enough
to pull me out of flow and the joy of the trail.

[Attention](/2013-05-31_fighting-information-overload-and-beyond#context-switches)
and [mental energy](/2012-08-25_not_whether_you_agree_but_how_much_you_care) are
largely zero sum games. You can improve them over time, but in the moment,
thinking about one thing means you're not thinking about something else. We're
already saddled with petty brains that constantly worry about our kids' next
report card, or the zinger we should have delivered in yesterday's meeting, than
what's going on in front of us. _Be here now_ and _live in the moment_ are
cliches for a reason. Our therapist don't often tell us, "You're too outwardly
focused. Dwell on your own issues more!"

At the same time, compelling experiences in the real world are often fleeting,
easy to spoil or miss altogether. It's usually not enough just to be there.
You have to be open minded, ready and willing to jump in with both feet, and
above all, paying attention. Naturally, reading Twitter on your phone doesn't
count, but I'd argue that too much tracking can cause the same problem. You're
right there in the thick of it physically, sure, but your head is only half in
the game. The other half is imagining the bump in your stats and composing the
perfect status message to share them with.

This is the same reason I'm uncomfortable with ideas like
[social first](http://jackealtman.com/socialfirst-the-new-way-to-live),
[pictures or it didn't happen](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pics%20or%20it%20didn%27t%20happen),
[if you didn't blog it, it didn't happen](http://dashes.com/anil/2011/01/if-you-didnt-blog-it-it-didnt-happen.html),
and even
[you can't improve what you don't measure](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/632992-measurement-is-the-first-step-that-leads-to-control-and),
at least when we apply them to our personal lives. (Don't get me started on
[Klout](http://klout.com/) and friends.)

I'm dangerously close to turning into a cliche here, for which I apologize, and
commiserate. Nothing makes me glaze over quite as fast as the tired old
"technology is dehumanizing" or "smartphones are turning us into zombies" memes.
Kids these days, indeed. That's not where I'm coming from, promise. Technology
and data are wonderful, powerful tools. They empower us in ways we couldn't
imagine even mere decades ago, and largely still can't. I take full advantage,
and I'm grateful.

Still, the usual caveat applies. Tools aren't inherently good and bad; it's how
they're used that matters. I know tracking is meant to complement real life
experiences, not replace them, but I wonder if it often does more harm than
good.

As usual, smarter people have put this much more eloquently than I ever
could. Jared Lanier's gently chides in
_[You Are Not a Gadget](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6683549-you-are-not-a-gadget)_:

> It is easier to set up a rigid representation of human [life] on digital
> networks...and that reduction of life is what gets broadcast between friends
> all the time. What is communicated between people eventually becomes their
> truth. Relationships take on the troubles of software engineering.  
> ...  
> The central mistake of recent digital culture is to chop up a network of
> individuals so finely that you end up with a mush. You then start to care
> about the abstraction...more than the real people who are networked, even
> though the network by itself is meaningless. Only the people were ever
> meaningful.  
> ...  
> The deep meaning of personhood is being reduced by illusions of bits. Since

> here on out, we must find an alternative.

David Foster Wallace's tone in
_[This is Water](http://books.google.com/books?id=lfAFVtz-at8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22probably%20the%20most%20dangerous%22&f=false)_
is even softer and more introspective:

> Probably the most dangerous thing...is my tendency to to over-intellectualize
> stuff, to get lost in abstract thinking instead of simply paying attention to
> what's going on in front of me.

Our personal lives and time are precious, and there are more things in heaven
and earth than are aggregated in your data. I could record that Mayfield Slough
run in full HD video, track my exact location and environmental sensor readings
and all sorts of biomarkers, and I'd still never be able to capture the feeling
of running alongside purple water and a yellow sky and shining silver cliffs,
flying above a tiny sliver of land bridge through air so still I was scared to
breathe. The exhilaration is priceless. For me, if it's a choice between data
and immersion, between tracking and raw experience, I choose experience. How
about you?
