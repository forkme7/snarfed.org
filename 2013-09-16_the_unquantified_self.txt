One of my favorite runs is the
[Mayfield Slough loop](http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/fullscreen/411912/), in
the heart of the wetlands just above Shoreline Amphitheatre. I'd run it at
sunset on weekdays, and I'd often go for five or six isolated miles across a
land bridge and along the bay without seeing anyone else. The landscape was
otherworldly, the light bruised and unsettling, and combined with the utter
absence of anything man-made, the overall sensation was hauntingly, desolately,
post-apocalyptically beautiful. It was a hell of an escape, one I've never quite
been able to reproduce.

I tried tracking it with a pedometer and GPS a couple times, and I hated it. I
fiddled with the gadgets, distracted myself with the stats and map trail I was
generating, chided myself for slow times and basked in the self-satisfaction of
a fast split. I did pretty much everything _except_ immerse myself in the flow
of running and the experience of being there, in that place, at that moment.

I used to love tracking myself. Call it what you want - quantified self,
personal analytics, lifelogging - I did it for a while, pretty consistently,
about a decade ago. I [tracked everything I did](http://snarfed.org/bigbrother),
at a high level, and then crunched the numbers and generated
[lots of charts and graphs](http://snarfed.org/ryan.barrett.name/bigbrother/). I
wasn't on any specific mission, just the usual "track stuff because I can!"
engineer thing, but it was still fun.

I've been off the quantified self bus for a while now. As conversations with my
friends have gradually filled with "Training? My
[Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com/) says it's going ok!" and "Little baby Alice has
been sleeping almost through the night, according to our
[Withings](http://withings.com/)!" and nearby hackers put together
[entire personal APIs](http://x.naveen.com/post/51808692792/a-personal-api),
I've developed an allergy to tracking myself. At this point, I'm almost entirely
unquantified, measureless, devoid of analytics. Sometimes I wonder how I manage
to keep myself alive at all.

I'm not sure why this is. No, it's not
[the privacy thing](/2011-08-03_why_im_weird_about_privacy). I don't think it's
fear of the unknown, either. I'm pretty
[happy with my life](/2012-08-14_streamlined_life), overall, and I don't _think_
I'm fooling myself about anything big there. I'm definitely not unwilling or
unable; I've [spent my career](/resume) building and running large software
systems and stressing about uptime, so I've lived and breathed tracking and
monitoring and realtime stats. It's
[complex](2011-12-09_can_software_learn_from_nuclear_power), sure, but it's the
only way to build anything reliable at that scale.

Some of it may be that tracking something turns it into work, at least for me,
and not in a good way. When I'm off the clock, nothing turns me off faster than
measuring things and crunching numbers. I'm ok with work _at_ work, but not
outside it. I want to enjoy my personal life! I'd track something for good
reason - for example, if I get sick and need to monitor my health and make big
lifestyle changes - but not just to get a little better at something, or because
I can, or for the hell of it.

That personality trait isn't universal, of course. Far from it. If you have even
an ounce of drive or ambition, or the slightest hint of a competitive streak, or
you're goal oriented or respond well to deadlines and milestones, or you just
want to get better at a hobby, you'll probably end up tracking something. It's
often unavoidable. That's not me, though. You know how _hungry_ is often used as
a compliment, as in _That founding team is hungry, we'd better snap them up
before someone else gives them a term sheet. I'm not hungry. I'm content. I've
been lucky enough to accomplish a couple things here and there, but generally
out of interest, not drive.

Beyond personality, I've spent lots of my time dealing with data, of all shapes
and sizes. Aggregation, time series databases, baselines and trending and
anomaly detection, they don't hold many surprises. And time again, regardless of
what it is I'm measuring and analyzing, I've seen how easy it is for meaning to
sink down and disappear between the endless waves of metrics. When I was
tracking myself on that Mayfield Slough run, it didn't matter whether I was
actively checking the gadgets. Simply knowing that data was flowing in the
background was enough to taint it, distracting me enough to pull me out of flow
and the ineffable joy of the trail.

I'm flirting with a dangerous cliche here. Nothing makes me glaze over quite as
fast as the tired old "technology is dehumanizing us" or "smartphones are
turning us into zombies" memes. Kids these days, indeed. That's not where I'm
coming from. I may still be a bit old /fashioned, though, in what I want.
I know tracking is meant to complement real life experiences, not replace them,
but I wonder if it often does more harm than good.

This is the same reason I'm uncomfortable with ideas like
[social first](http://jackealtman.com/socialfirst-the-new-way-to-live),
[pictures or it didn't happen](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pics%20or%20it%20didn%27t%20happen),
[if you didn't blog it it didn't happen](http://dashes.com/anil/2011/01/if-you-didnt-blog-it-it-didnt-happen.html),
and even
[you can't improve what you don't measure](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/632992-measurement-is-the-first-step-that-leads-to-control-and),
at least applied to our personal lives. (Don't get me started on
[Klout](http://klout.com/) and friends.)

[Attention](/2013-05-31_fighting-information-overload-and-beyond#context-switches)
and [mental energy](/2012-08-25_not_whether_you_agree_but_how_much_you_care) are
zero sum games. You can improve them over time, but in the moment, thinking
about one thing means you're not thinking about something else. We're already
saddled with petty brains that prefer to worry about our kids' next report card,
or the zinger we should have delivered in yesterday's meeting, than what's going
on in front of us. Be here now and live in the moment are cliches for a reason.
It's hard to imagine a therapist saying, "You're too outwardly focused. Dwell on
your own issues more!"

At the same time, compelling experiences in the real world are often fleeting,
and easy to spoil or miss altogether. It's usually not enough just to be there.
You have to be open minded, ready and willing to jump in with both feet, and
above all, paying attention. Naturally, reading Twitter on your phone doesn't
count, but I'd argue that too much tracking can cause the same problem. You're
right there in the thick of it physically, sure, but your head is only half in
the game. The other half is imagining the bump in your stats and drafting the
perfect message to share them with.

Tracking can definitely be valuable, for the right people, as part of a
"balanced [mental] breakfast." It's better as a scalpel than a chainsaw, though.
detracts from being in the moment,
and in the longer term from other activities.


My complaint isn't that data or tracking or even social first are bad, or not
for me, but that qualitative experience and meaning are good, in all their
personal, indescribable subtlety.

Data is powerful and seductive. It empowers us in ways we couldn't imagine even
mere decades ago, and largely still can't. It's made our lives better in all
sorts of ways, big and small. I take full advantage of many of those advances,
and I'm grateful.

Even so, there's more to life than data. I could record that Mayfield Slough run
in full HD video, track my exact location and environmental sensor readings and
all sorts of biomarkers, and I'd still never be able to capture the feeling of
running alongside purple water and a yellow sky and shining silver cliffs,
flying above a tiny sliver of land bridge through air so still I was scared to
breathe. The exhilaration is priceless. For me, if it's a choice between data
and immersion, between tracking and raw experience, I choose experience. How
about you?
