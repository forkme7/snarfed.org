[App Engine](http://appengine.google.com/) has been a great home for the past four years. It's been an unforgettable experience - co-founding something so ambitious, iterating for years, the [adrenaline rush of launch](/2008-04-07_google_app_engine_launched), seeing it grow and mature and make its way in the world, and most of all helping build a brilliant, awesome team. They pushed me and kept me on my toes the whole time, and I loved it. I'll miss them.

Even so, it's time to move on something new. I've always wanted to work on networking, [and](/windows_p2p) [I've](/libmsntp) [dabbled](/p4) [in](/synchronizing_mp3_playback) [it](/software) [some](/ideas), but I'm finally going to do it for real. After looking around and talking to lots of people, I finally settled on the network systems group at Google. I'll likely start with the system that generates and monitors routing tables for all of our network devices, based on interesting constraints.

At first, though, I'll just be learning. A lot. Wish me luck!
