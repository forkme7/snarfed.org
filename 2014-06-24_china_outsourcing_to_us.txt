The AP reports on a growing trend of [Chinese companies outsourcing jobs to the US](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ni-hao-yall-us-hinterlands-woo-chinese-firms), reversing our long-lived habit of outsourcing to China. Reminds me of similarly surprising news that [net immigration between the US and Mexico hit zero](/2014-03-10_8364) a couple years ago.

Globalization doesn't play favorites, no matter how hard activists protest. Living standards and cost of labor rise in other countries? The world adapts, expectations be damned.
