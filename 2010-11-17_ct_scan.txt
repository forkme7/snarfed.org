My sinuses have been unhappy lately, so I went to [an ENT](http://sfotomed.com/dr-kim-otolaryngology-medical-group-bay-area-ca.html) a few days ago for a consultation. We're still investigating, but on the plus side, I got to keep the raw data from a few [CT scans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan) of my head, just like [when I had an MRI](/2009-03-14_mri). Check out the [pictures and animations](/ct_scan_images_and_animations)!
