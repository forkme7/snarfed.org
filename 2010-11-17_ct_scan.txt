CT scan

My sinuses have been unhappy lately, so I went to
[an ENT](http://sfotomed.com/dr-kim-otolaryngology-medical-group-bay-area-ca.html)
a few days ago for a consultation. We're still investigating, but on the plus
side, I got to keep the raw data from a few
[CT scans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan) of my head, just like
[when I had an MRI](2009-03-14_mri). Check out the
[pictures and animations](ct_scan_images_and_animations)!
