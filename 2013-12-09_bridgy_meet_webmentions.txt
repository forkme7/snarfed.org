Brid.gy, meet Webmentions

One of the side projects I've been working on (again) is
[Brid.gy](http://brid.gy/), a service that
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed">backfeeds</a> comments on social
networks to the web pages linked in the posts.
[When I originally launched Brid.gy](/2012-01-08_bridgy_launched) a couple years
ago, it only supported WordPress, but it now sends
[webmentions](http://www.webmention.org/), which are supported in
[lots of servers](http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention#Implementations). I also
made a added Instagram, made a bunch of smaller improvements, and updated the
look and feel. Check out
[this example of backfed comments](http://snarfed.org/2013-12-07_goodbye-penny-arcade-report#comments)
on this site, then feel free to [try it out](http://brid.gy/) yourself!


The update was inspired by the [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) community,
who have been doing all sorts of great work around making personal web sites a
viable alternative to social network profiles. Thanks all!
