Announcing libmsntp

I've released [libmsntp](/libmsntp) 1.6a, an
[SNTP](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2030.html) library for \*nix. This is the
first public release. libmsntp provides both server and client functionality,
and is intended for any program that needs to synchronize clocks or query
another computer's clock over the network.

We're planning to use libmsntp in our never-ending quest for [synchronizing mp3
playback](/synchronizing_mp3_playback). Maybe someday we'll even ship
something!
