Comment: viable two-factor authentication

<div class="h-entry">
<p class="p-name e-content">

Out of curiosity, do you have anything against app-based 2FA, a la Google
Authenticator and friends, as opposed to SMS-based? It generally doesn't require
any kind of connectivity at all. I'm happily using it for six different
2FA-enabled accounts.
