My latest side projects provide Atom feeds for your
[Facebook news feed](https://facebook-atom.appspot.com/), your
[Twitter stream](https://twitter-atom.appspot.com/), or any
[Twitter list](https://twitter-atom.appspot.com/).
You can use them to read your friends' posts in an RSS/Atom feed reader instead
of directly on Facebook or Twitter. Try them out!

Facebook used to provide
[RSS for the news feed](http://stackoverflow.com/a/10190683/186123), but they
[deprecated it](http://www.kristi-barrow.com/facebook-rss-feeds-what-is-available/)
a couple years ago and
[dropped it altogether](https://plus.google.com/+TamarWeinberg/posts/hk18JNmtZQv)
a couple weeks ago. The only working solution I've found is
[JWZ's `facebook-rss.pl` script](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2009/12/how-to-use-facebook-with-a-feed-reader/),
which works but isn't very accessible.

Twitter also used to support RSS and Atom in their API, but they
[deprecated them](http://mashable.com/2012/09/05/twitter-api-rss/) when they
announced the new API, and recently
[dropped them altogether](https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/11831). There's
[a Yahoo Pipe](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=f49405304db01792c182c01ebd1d1b34)
that does the conversion, but it uses the old API and doesn't authenticate,
which the
[new API requires](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api),
so it won't last long.

The source for both apps is [on](https://github.com/snarfed/facebook-atom)
[Github](https://github.com/snarfed/twitter-atom). The heavy lifting is done by
my
[ActivityStreams bridge project](/2012-03-12_activitystreams_for_facebook_and_twitter).
Enjoy!
