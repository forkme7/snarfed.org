A few days ago, my article on [GMail vs. Pine](/gmail_vs_pine) was [posted to Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/05/1936209). Soon after, it was posted to [Digg](http://digg.com/software/Gmail_vs._Pine), [Reddit](http://reddit.com/info/41sx/comments), and other geek news sites.

The torrent of traffic quickly brought my poor little server [to](/slashdotted_referrers.html) [its](/slashdotted_days.html) [knees](/slashdotted_overview.html). I tried bringing it back up, but the flood of visitors put it right back down again. I had no choice but to wait until the story ran its course and fell off the Slashdot front page. My [hosting company](http://jvds.com/) was not amused.

So, apologies for the outage. On the plus side, it generated a [lot](http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=182257&threshold=-1&mode=thread&commentsort=0&op=Change) [of](http://digg.com/software/Gmail_vs._Pine) [comments](/gmail_vs_pine#comments). Digg user [oltompic](http://digg.com/users/oltompic) posted my [favorite](http://digg.com/software/Gmail_vs._Pine#c1399570):

> IT'S JUST E-MAIL !!!

> read your e-mail and send your e-mail. holy shit.

Eloquent in its simplicity. I can only hope to achieve to such a Zen outlook on life, liberty, and the pursuit of email nirvana.
