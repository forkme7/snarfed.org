IndieWeb people: update your webmention discovery

Hey [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) developers! We recently added an important feature to the [Webmention](http://webmention.org/) spec: [discovery by `<a>` tag](https://github.com/converspace/webmention/blob/master/README.md#sender-discovers-receiver-endpoint). If you maintain webmention code or have an IndieWeb site that sends webmentions, please add this! It should be just a few lines of code; [here's an example](https://github.com/vrypan/webmention-tools/commit/f29879a29617960f3a680cba015af2858d0cd167).

Originally, web sites could advertise their webmention endpoint in the `Link` HTTP header or in a `<link rel="webmention">` HTML tag. This change adds the option to use `<a rel="webmention">` too. This is useful on hosts that don't allow custom HTTP headers or `<link>` tags, [notably WordPress.com](http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/#html-tags).

This change was inspired by a big new [Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy/) feature: webmention support for Blogger, Tumblr, and WordPress.com. (More about that soon!) Blogger and Tumblr let you add `<link>` tags, but WordPress.com doesn't, so we needed this to close the loop there.

Happy hacking!
