It's been a while since [Vanessa](http://vanessaart.com/)'s last art show, but
she's spent the summer back here in town and she's kicking off a new collection
in Rockridge with a
[reception this Friday](https://www.facebook.com/events/100799076738143/). The
collection will be up through November, but all the cool kids will be hanging
out and catching up over drinks and snacks at the reception. Come join us!

Details: Friday September 7, 6-8 pm at
[McGuire Real Estate](http://www.mcguire.com/offices/Rockridge). Catering by
[Market Hall](http://rockridgemarkethall.com/).

On a related note, this is just one of the
[new paintings](http://vanessaart.com/) you'll get to see up close and personal.
Bonus points if you can guess who it is!
