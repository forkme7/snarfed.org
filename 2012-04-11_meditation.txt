Meditation

<p class="right"><img src="/meditation.jpg" /></p>

I started meditating a week or so ago. I took an introductory class, then added
a session to my daily routine, and I've been keeping up with it pretty
faithfully so far. It's...interesting!

I'm not particularly spiritual, but the
[health benefits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation#Scientific_studies),
both mental and physical, are well established. I'm always interested in ways to
be more effective at work, play, relationships, etc., and meditation has been on
my todo list for a while.

I'm still a beginner, so I'm not doing anything exotic yet, just ten minutes of
"mindfulness" meditation a day. I sit upright, eyes closed, alert but relaxed,
and think about breathing. I try to focus entirely on the physical sensation of
air rushing in through my nose, then out again.

When a thought occurs to me, or I hear a sound, or that little voice inside my
head pipes up, I try to acknowledge it, let it pass, and return my attention to
breathing. It's hard, and I'm still bad at it, but supposedly I'll get better
over time.

It's too early to say, but I'll post again if I notice any big changes. Fingers
crossed!
