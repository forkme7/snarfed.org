Why I don't have reply contexts

I post [indie replies](http://indiewebcamp.com/comment) [here](/responses) on snarfed.org, but I don't include [reply contexts](http://indiewebcamp.com/reply-context), which results in poor UX on the reply pages.

Why don't I include reply contexts? The short answer is, because it would take some grungy work on my WordPress theme, which I generally avoid. I hate hacking on CMSes!

Reply contexts also just aren't really a [personal itch](http://indiewebcamp.com/distinguished) for me. I don't really want to emphasize my replies or likes to my site's visitors at all, which is also why I hide them away and don't include them in any (h-)feeds.
