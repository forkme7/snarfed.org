Susan's coming to visit!!! She'll be here from Wednesday 6/16 to Tuesday 6/22.
If you want to hang out with her while she's here, [let me know](/about). I've
tried to connect up with people, but you all know how bad my memory is, much
less my ability to plan any farther than about a day in advance. :P

Oh, and if you missed it the first time, I may have a girlfriend, but I'm still
a [big fat geek](/ryan.barrett.name/countdown.js), just counting the seconds
until she gets here.
