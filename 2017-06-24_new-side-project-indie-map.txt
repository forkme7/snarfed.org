I'm launching a new side project today! [Indie Map](http://www.indiemap.org/) is a public [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) social graph and dataset. It's a complete crawl of 2300 of the most active IndieWeb sites, sliced and diced and rolled up in a few useful ways:

* Social graph [API](http://www.indiemap.org/docs.html#api) and [interactive map](http://www.indiemap.org/map.html).
* [SQL queryable dataset](http://www.indiemap.org/docs.html#dataset) and [GUI analytics](http://metabase.indiemap.org/public/dashboard/d46209c0-170d-49a7-a50d-8be64b577f36).
* [Raw crawl data](http://www.indiemap.org/docs.html#crawl) in [WARC](http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/) format: [2300 sites](https://github.com/snarfed/indie-map/blob/master/crawl/domains.txt), 5.7M pages, 380GB HTML + [mf2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2).

The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)'s raison d'Ãªtre is to do social networking on individual personal web sites instead of centralized silos. Some parts have been fairly straightforward to decentralize - publishing, [reading](https://indieweb.org/reader), [interacting](https://indieweb.org/interactions) - but others are more difficult. Social graph and data mining fall squarely in the latter camp, which is why the community hasn't tackled them much so far. I hope this inspires us to do more!

_Indie Map was announced at [IndieWeb Summit 2017](https://2017.indieweb.org/). Check out the [slide deck](/indiemap_iws2017/) and [video of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkc5afFohmI)!_
