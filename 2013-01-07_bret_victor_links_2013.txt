Bret Victor's Links 2013

[Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)'s
_[Links 2013](http://worrydream.com/Links2013/)_ collects his favorite talks,
papers, books, and a game ([yay!](/games)) from the year, and it's an amazing
list. I ended up adding pretty much all of them to my queue. Hell of a job
curating, Bret. Thank you!
