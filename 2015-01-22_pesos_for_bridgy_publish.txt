*[POSSE](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE)ing silo interactions is
[getting harder by the day](https://kylewm.com/2015/01/the-facebook-api-v2-0-is-hobbled-to-prevent-spammy),
and [Bridgy Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publish) is suffering as a
result. We could fix this by adding an
[OwnYourGram](http://ownyourgram.com/)-style
[PESOS](https://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS) option. Should we?*

If you're going to [own your posts](https://indiewebcamp.com/silo) on social
networks, [indieweb](https://indiewebcamp.com/) people
[prefer to POSSE](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE#Advantages): post on your own
site, syndicate elsewhere. [Bridgy Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publish)
follows this philosophy and provides POSSE as a service.

POSSE has its disadvantages though. The Twitter app, for example, lets you
favorite a tweet with a single tap and ~100ms latency. Best of breed mobile
indieweb approaches can't touch that right now. Mine, for example, usually take
[many more taps](/easy-indieweb-interactions-on-android)
[and 10-20s](/indie-checkin-flow). Browser-based implementations and
[webactions](https://indiewebcamp.com/webactions) are a bit better, but not a
lot.

More importantly, the silos don't even allow POSSEing
[interactions](https://indiewebcamp.com/interactions) consistently, or at all.
Facebook's 2.0 API
[prevents commenting](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/350)
[liking](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.2/user/likes#publish),
[and resharing](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.2/object/sharedposts#publish)
in many cases. Instagram's API
[supports liking, but not commenting](https://indiewebcamp.com/Instagram#API).
Google+'s API
[doesn't support writing](https://indiewebcamp.com/Google%2B#POSSE), full stop.
Twitter has a fairly complete write API, but take it with a
[grain of salt](https://indiewebcamp.com/Twitter#Developer_Relations).

Proposal: what if we added a Bridgy Publish PESOS option alongside the current
POSSE model?

The arguments [for POSSE](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE#Advantages) and
[against PESOS](https://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS#Disadvantages) are well founded.
They're also aimed primarily at posts, not interactions. For interactions with
single silo posts, especially likes and reposts, which rarely include additional
content, PESOS ain't so bad, and it comes with two big benefits:

* Full support for all interactions in all silos.
* Use the silos' native UXes (often single-tap and low latency), databases
(venues, contacts, etc.), and other features (e.g. character counting) for free.
No need to reimplement them or bolt them onto your own site.

Some of the [PESOS drawbacks](https://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS#Disadvantages)
still apply. It enables silo-first authoring and presentation, and maybe
slightly discourages indie and cross-silo interactions. Those would still be
just as doable, though, since we'd keep the current POSSE functionality.

Adding this to Bridgy Publish would be a big project, but it's doable. Bridgy
would watch your silo account for replies, likes, and reshares that you create
inside the silo (ie that bridgy publish didn't create). When it sees one, it
create a matching original post on your site, via
[micropub](http://micropub.net/) or whatever, including
[rel-syndication link](https://indiewebcamp.com/rel-syndication). (I despair at
implementing even just the
[token management](http://indiewebcamp.com/micropub#Authentication), much less a
full micropub client, but those are literally implementation details.)

Thoughts?
