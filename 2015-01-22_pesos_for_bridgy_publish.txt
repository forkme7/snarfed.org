*TL;DR: POSSEing silo interactions is
[getting harder by the day](https://kylewm.com/2015/01/the-facebook-api-v2-0-is-hobbled-to-prevent-spammy),
and [Bridgy Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publish) is suffering as a
result. We could fix this by adding [OwnYourGram](http://ownyourgram.com/)-style
[PESOS](https://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS) as an option. Should we?*

If you're going to
[own your replies, likes, reshares, etc.](https://indiewebcamp.com/silo), the
[indieweb](https://indiewebcamp.com/)
[prefers the POSSE model](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE#Advantages).
[Bridgy Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publish) follows this philosophy and
provides POSSE as a service.

POSSE has its disadvantages, though. The Twitter app, for example, lets you
favorite a tweet with a single tap and ~100ms latency. Even the best of breed
mobile indieweb approaches take
[many more taps](/easy-indieweb-interactions-on-android)
[and 10-20s](/indie-checkin-flow) right now, and the browser implementations
aren't often much better, even [webactions](https://indiewebcamp.com/webactions).

More importantly, many of the silos don't consistently allow POSSEing
[interactions](https://indiewebcamp.com/interactions), if at all. Facebook's
v2.x API
[indirectly prevents commenting and liking many users' posts](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/350),
and
[doesn't allow liking pages](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.2/user/likes#publish)
[or resharing](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.2/object/sharedposts#publish)
at all. Instagram's API
[only supports liking, not commenting](https://indiewebcamp.com/Instagram#API).
Google+'s API
[doesn't support writing](https://indiewebcamp.com/Google%2B#POSSE), full stop.
Twitter is the only top tier silo with a full(ish) write API, but even that
includes a grain of salt, given their
[mixed track record with developers](https://indiewebcamp.com/Twitter#Developer_Relations).

*Proposal: what if we added a PESOS option to Bridgy Publish alongside the
current POSSE model?*

The arguments [for POSSE](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE#Advantages) and
[against PESOS](https://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS#Disadvantages) are well taken.
They're also aimed primarily at posts, not interactions. For a single
interaction with a single silo post, especially a like or a retweet that (often)
eschews additional content, there aren't as many meaningful drawbacks
to POSSE, and there are two big benefits:

* Full support for all interactions in all silos.
* Use the silos' native UXes (often single-tap and low latency), databases
(venues, contacts, etc.), and other features (e.g. character counting) for free;
no need to find or implement them in your own site.

Bridgy would watch your silo account for replies, likes, and reshares that you
create inside the silo (ie that bridgy publish didn't create). When it sees one,
it create a matching original post on your site, via micropub or whatever,
including [rel-syndication link](https://indiewebcamp.com/rel-syndication).

Some of the [PESOS drawbacks](https://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS#Disadvantages)
still apply. It enables silo-first authoring and presentation, and maybe
slightly discourages indie and cross-silo interactions. The current POSSE
functionality would remain, though, so they'd still be just as doable as they
are now.

Thoughts?
