Next Tuesday, [Dan](http://kodiak.brainymonkey.com/) and I are going to see
[Paul Oakenfold](http://pauloakenfold.com/) spin at [1015](http://1015.com/) in
San Francisco.

Along with [Paul van Dyk](http://paulvandyk.com/) and
[John Digweed](http://johndigweed.com/), Oakenfold is easily one of the top
three DJs in the world. I've [seen PvD](/2006-03-02_good_music_good_food_mean_people) and Digweed live
before, but not Oakenfold, so I'm psyched.

If you're in the area and you like dance music,
[grab tickets](http://www.wantickets.com/affiliates/affiliate_event_detail.asp?e_id=28993&id=277)
and join us!
