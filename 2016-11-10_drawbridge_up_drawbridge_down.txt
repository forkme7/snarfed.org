When populations are homogenous, people see that others are generally like them - ethnically, culturally, socioeconomically, etc. This boosts trust in other people, broadly, which makes everyone more open to progressive social policies and safety nets.

When populations are diverse, people are more visibly different, at least on the surface, which leads to [othering](/2013-04-02_othering), dampens trust, and leads to more protectionist, socially conservative policies.

Even if this is obviously an oversimplification, there may still be a nugget of truth to it, even if only subconsciously. It's one possible reason that Scandinavian countries have long been so open, progressive, even socialist: their populations are extremely homogenous. North America and western Europe, on the other hand, are historically diverse and now more than ever, and they've recently seen waves of divisive nationalism, isolationism, and xenophobia.

[Stephan Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephan_Shakespeare), co-founder of pollster [YouGov](https://yougov.com/), describes this as ["drawbridge up" vs "drawbridge down"](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21702748-new-divide-rich-countries-not-between-left-and-right-between-open-and):

> We are either “drawbridge up” or “drawbridge down”. Are you someone who feels your life is being encroached upon by criminals, gypsies, spongers, asylum-seekers, Brussels bureaucrats? Do you think the bad things will all go away if we lock the doors? Or do you think it’s a big beautiful world out there, full of good people, if only we could all open our arms and embrace each other?

...and begs the question, regardless of which way you feel, *why* do you feel that way? This could be one answer.

Subtle, powerful point that I hadn't fully appreciated until now. [Thanks to Jonathan Haidt.](http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_can_a_divided_america_heal)
