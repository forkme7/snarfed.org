I'm about to finish and post my next side project,
[activitystreams-unofficial](https://github.com/snarfed/activitystreams-unofficial).
My last post was a side project too, though, so I'm reluctant to post another
right away, since I want this blog to be more about other things.

Unfortunately, I don't have anything special to say right now. Life is good,
friends and family are good, work and side projects are good. I have a couple
future posts brewing, but they're still too early to write up just yet.

So, uh...hey look, is that a cat rolling a watermelon out of a lake?
