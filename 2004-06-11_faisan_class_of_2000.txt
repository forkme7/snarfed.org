Faisan, Class of 2000

<p class="right"><img class="shadow" src="faisan_thumb.jpg" /></p>

Yesterday I took off from work a little early, drove up to Palo Alto, and went
to a reunion for the class of 2000. This wasn't a high school or college
reunion, though. No, it was a [dorm reunion](/faisan_reunion_2004).

**Update**: I dug up a few pictures. [Secret Snowflake,
anyone?](/faisan_reunion_2004#post).
