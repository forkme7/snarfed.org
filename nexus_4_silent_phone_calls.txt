My Nexus 4 recently started exhibiting an annoying bug: no audio in phone calls.
Sometimes I could hear the other person but they couldn't hear me, sometimes
vice versa. Sometimes neither. Rebooting fixed it, but only for a little while.

A few searches led me to
[these](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=82949)
[two](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=81093)
bug reports, and to
[this](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=82949#c440)
[workaround](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=81093#c36): open
Settings, Developer, go to the Media section, and disable NuPlayer. Works for me
so far!
