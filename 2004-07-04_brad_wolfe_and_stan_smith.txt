I went with Andrew, Sylvia, Ken, etc. to see [Brad Wolfe and the
Moon](http://bradwolfemusic.com/) at the [Last Day
Saloon](http://lastdaysaloon.com/san%20francisco/sanfrancisco.html), and I had a
blast. I've seen Brad a few times this year, and he's come a long way from
strumming chords in Stern Hall. Brad sounds like a mix of David Gray and Dave
Matthews, but that barely does him justice. He's a great singer, and he has a
band full of musicians who are talented in their own right, but I was most
impressed by his songwriting. Brad's songs have a ton of potential.

Also, the show was a welcome departure from the standard club fare of top 40,
hip-hop, and house that I get most weekends. The venue had a cozy, small-band
feel, and the crowd was packed with Stanford people who probably all knew Brad
"back when." If you're in the area, try to catch [one of his
shows](http://bradwolfemusic.com/shows.html).

Seeing Brad inspired me to look up another friend from Stanford who was a
talented songwriter, Stan Smith. Stan led a band called Westin Copher with great
songwriting and unique vocals, and played with them in Atlanta over the summers.
I listen to Stan's music a lot, but hadn't caught up with him recently. A quick
Google search turned up [Line Of Sight](http://lineofsightmusic.com/), Stan's
new band. They have songs and pictures available, so go check them out!
