I've revised my site's style a bit to make it denser and use space

more effectively. I shrunk fonts and line spacing, tightened up the

header image and text, and flattened the comments horizontally.



I'm still a fan of the "big thin font" trend, but

[its first incarnation here](/2010-08-08_migrated_to_wordpress)

wantonly wasted screen real estate. This is just a tweak,

definitely still based on

[Ryu](http://wordpress.org/themes/ryu/), but with hopefully a bit

more respect for my readers.
