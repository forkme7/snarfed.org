**About**

<img src="/album.jpg">

We've created a simple macro that creates a photo album interface for pictures. Our macro generates thumbnails for a set of pictures and shows the thumbnails on the same page. Each thumbnail is a link to a slideshow! "web-sized" images are used in the slideshow, and a link to the full-sized version is also provided. By "web-sized" we mean 800px, but you can define that in the parameters, please see **Usage**.

**Download**

You can [download MakeAlbum.jar](http://cs.stanford.edu/~maulik/MakeAlbum.jar) here.

**Usage**

version-a-little-more-than-before:

Goodbye config file! Hello plug and play!

To use make-album just pop the jar into your application's WEB-INF/lib directory and restart the server. Make a new snip using this following tag:

```
{make-album:albumDirName}
```

Where albumDirName is a directory in your application's images directory.
Default thumbnail size is 240px and default web-size is 800px. if you'd like to
change them, you can specify those as parameters like so:

```
{make-album:albumDirName|thumb_size|web_size}
```

Where thumb_size and web_size are integers.

Also, if you're running this on **linux, unix**, etc. you will need to modify
your run script to include this java flag:

```
java -Djava.awt.headless=true
```

Please see **Notes** for more.

**Future plans**

Next on the list is to make a **very** user friendly way to enter captions....

**Notes**

Fix! Some of you may have noticed that some thumbnails/websized images ended up
being of a psychedelic nature. if you use the new jar, you will no longer notice
that effect as the method for resizing pictures has been changed.

Source and a Makefile are included in MakeAlbum.jar.

As promised, more on the headless issue: On Linux (or \*nix), please run java
with the -Djava.awt.headless=true option. (You can add this to run.sh.) If this
system property is not set, AWT will try to connect to an X Windows display,
which usually won't work since SnipSnap is a server. If you're on Linux, and you
see "make-album: none" in red when you use the make-album macro, this should
solve your problem.

Stay tuned!
