I follow the game industry pretty closely. It's a hobby, of sorts. I
[read](/feeds) and [listen to](/podcasts) lots of criticism and industry
analysis, but for a long time, [Edge](http://edge-online.com/) was the only
outlet I read regularly, cover to cover.

That changed two years ago when [Ben Kuchera](https://twitter.com/benkuchera)
started the [Penny Arcade Report](http://penny-arcade.com/report). He took a
thoughtful, opinionated approach, covering major stories only when he had
something to say, diving deep into wonderful rabbit holes that other outlets
would pass on. His
[stream-of-consciousness Far Cry 3 travelogue](http://penny-arcade.com/report/article/this-is-your-island-par-plays-far-cry-3)
is one of the best pieces of game writing I've ever read, bar none. Read it.

Ben assembled a [great team](http://penny-arcade.com/report/about) and PAR
quickly joined Edge as my second games journalism staple. Sadly, after two years
of top notch work, they announced yesterday that
[they're closing shop](http://penny-arcade.com/report/article/it-was-a-great-two-years-but-now-its-time-to-say-goodbye).
The Penny Arcade guys
[feel like they've spread themselves too thin](http://penny-arcade.com/2013/12/06/changes),
so they're trying to consolidate and refocus on their core projects. Tragically,
PAR is one of the casualties.

[Ben](https://twitter.com/benkuchera), [Sophie](https://twitter.com/sophiejkl),
[Kristin](https://twitter.com/peeardee), [Dabe](https://twitter.com/dabe):
condolences, and thanks for all the great writing. You guys rock. Best of luck,
can't wait to see what you do next!
