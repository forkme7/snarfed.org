twitter-atom is back!

One of my side projects, [Twitter Atom feeds](http://twitter-atom.appspot.com/)
(aka [twitter-atom](https://github.com/snarfed/twitter-atom)), has been down for
a couple months. It
[ran afoul](https://twitter.com/snarfed_org/status/347667926591107073) of
Twitter's [new API terms](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/terms/summary), which
cracked down on syndicating tweets outside of the Twitter walled garden, in any
form.

Fortunately, I've tweaked the design a bit, and it's now back up! If you used it
before, you'll want to [regenerate your feed](http://twitter-atom.appspot.com/)
and plug it back into your feed reader of choice. Feel free to [ping me](/about)
with any questions. Enjoy!
