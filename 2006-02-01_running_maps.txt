My workout regimen consists of running, lifting, and the occasional game of
tennis. I'm good about sticking to a routine, and I'm glad I do, but I don't
really keep track of how far I run or the routes I take.

I've always been curious about my runs, though. How far do I run? What's the
elevation change? Are there other interesting runs in the same area?

Friends at work recently turned me onto some great mashup sites that answer
these exact questions. I first tried [MapMyRun](http://mapmyrun.com/).
Within minutes, I'd mapped out
[a few of my regular routes](http://mapmyrun.com/user/63871/ryan).
MapMyRun gave me the distance, elevation, calorie estimate, and other
statistics. It also showed me
[nearby runs](http://www.mapmyrun.com/search?txtLocation=Palo+Alto%2C+CA&lstSearchBy=local_runs&lstSortBy=cs.rating+desc&btnSearch=SEARCH+%3E)
that other people had posted.

Others include [Gmaps Pedometer](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/) and [US Track &
Field's site](http://www.usatf.org/routes/), which aims to be the "largest
searchable database of running routes in the country." Ambitious, eh?
