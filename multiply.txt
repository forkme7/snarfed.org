[Multiply](http://multiply.com/)
is yet another social networking site. It's oriented toward people who want to
put a _lot_ of stuff online. It also has a pretty comprehensive set of tools for
importing contacts from address books and other social networking sites.

I can't say I use social networking sites much, but just to close the loop,
here's [my Multiply profile](http://ryanb.multiply.com/).
