Coffee breaks for the brain

<img class="right" src="coffee_cup.jpg" /></a>

I hate forced idle time. I used to carry reading material with me everywhere, in
case I had a few extra minutes. I still do that sometimes, but now I
[listen to podcasts](/podcasts) more often. I break out the headphones at any
excuse, even as little as walking between buildings at work, or while I'm
falling asleep. It's great. I can easily keep my brain engaged, no matter where
I am or what else I'm doing.

I wonder if there's a catch, though. At the end of a busy day, if I've had
headphones on throughout my workout and commute and squeezed some quick reading
into all the leftover moments, my brain feels a bit...cramped. Uncomfortably
full. Like it's had three square meals, and a bunch of snacks, and a big
dessert, but hasn't had a chance to digest anything. Which, arguably, is exactly
what's happened.

I'm no neurobiologist, but I'm familiar with the popular science, and it rings
true for me personally. Sleep, for example - the ultimate idle time - probably
[plays a key role](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory#Sleep) in
building long term memory. The language center of the brain
[can't multitask very well](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-power-prime/201103/technology-myth-multitasking),
if at all,
[especially in men](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080303120346.htm).
The subconscious is our
[best tool for problem solving and decision making](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081224215542.htm).

As far as I can tell, my brain does most of its important thinking in the
background. Prioritizing, synthesizing, introspecting, predicting, thinking
holistically: it's all critical, but I rarely do any of it explicitly. I add
something to my todo list, or file it away in the back of my head, and when I
come back to it an hour or day or week later, chances are it's neatly broken
down and incorporated into the big picture.

When I haven't had enough idle time, when I've been especially aggressive with
the headphones and books, I suspect this process gets backed up. I feel
backlogged, mentally constipated, like I'm playing catch-up with all the
connections and mental leaps that I should have been making. It's not a good
feeling.

I don't have an addictive personality, in general. It's a blessing. I
[work](/resume), [eat](/restaurants), [drink](/whiskey), [watch TV](/tv),
[play games](/games), and do all sorts of things in natural, easy moderation.
Filling idle time, though...that might be an exception. I know I should relax
sometimes, put the phone away and just let my mind drift, but it's so hard.

What do you think? Do you ever feel the same? Have you found a way to protect
that precious downtime and keep your brain rested and recharged? How do you do
it?
