reasonable blougt

hi all! facilities is laying a bunch of new wiring in rains this week, so power
and network connectivity may be spotty. worse,
[http://kash.stanford.edu/](http://kash.stanford.edu/) is down and refuses to
come back up. long story, and i don't know if i'm smart enough to fix it. :/

in other news, if you're reading this and you're a jetty expert, please [email
me](mailto:rbarrett@stanford.edu)! i've been trying to set up virtual hostnames
and URL redirection with jetty (which serves snipsnap), but so far, no luck.

p.s. if you operate heavy machinery, please, for the love of god, [take the day
off](http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2003-07-11).
