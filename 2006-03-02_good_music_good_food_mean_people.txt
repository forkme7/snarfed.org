I'm late with this post...but with one notable exception, after the
[tennis tournament](2006-02-25_sap_open_tennis), the last couple weekends got
better and better.

I heard [Paul van Dyk](http://paulvandyk.de/) spin a three-hour set at
[1015](http://1015.com/), which was a blast. I'd
[seen him at 1015 before](2005-09-26_work_and_not_work), so I knew it would be
good. I also went to [Fresh](http://freshsf.com/) on Sunday, at
[Ruby Skye](http://rubyskye.com/), and heard a set by
[DJ Kimberly S](http://djkimberlys.com/). I'd never heard her before, but she
was great.

This past weekend, I
[heard Schumann and Strauss](http://www.sfsymphony.org/templates/event_info.asp?nodeid=250&callid=93&eventid=936)
at the [symphony](http://sfsymphony.com/), partied in fine style for a few
friends' birthdays, and went home on Sunday for Mardi Gras. My dad's family is
Cajun, so we had fun cooking gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice, and King
cake, tossing around beads and masks, and celebrating with lots of friends.

Unfortunately, it wasn't all fun and games. I was witness to
[this](http://www.sfexaminer.com/articles/2006/02/20/news/20060220_ne06_1015.txt)
at the Paul van Dyk concert at 1015. [Dan](http://kodiak.brainymonkey.com/) has
[written more](http://kodiak.brainymonkey.com/?p=259); apart from that, all I
can say is, I don't plan to make it a habit. Life goes on.

...and not a moment too soon, since I
[turn into a sled dog](http://www.urbaniditarod.com/) on Saturday. Mush, you
huskies!
