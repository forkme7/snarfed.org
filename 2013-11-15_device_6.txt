[Device 6](http://simogo.com/games/device6/) is one of the best games I've
played in a long time, and it's barely even a game at all. It takes a scalpel to
the fourth wall and lands somewhere between slick mystery novel, augmented
reality puzzle game, and live interactive theater. I felt like I was the
detective hero in a crazy film noir Twilight Zone episode, and I loved it.

It's only a few hours long and a few bucks
[on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/device-6/id680366065), and it's
worth every second and penny.
