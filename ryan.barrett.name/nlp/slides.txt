Goals:
- interesting linguistic features of IM
- classification engine that works well on IM
  - e.g. classification by emotion

- motivate people to use IM as a natural language source!

We built an IM corpus, tagged with emotions: 

fear     bl4ize      walter got really sick last night...my parents took care of him
fear     bl4ize      really scary
surprise billmagrath wow.  with what?
none     bl4ize      just flu
fear     bl4ize      but he has high blood pressure, so that made it even more scary
sadness  billmagrath thats too bad.
joy      bl4ize      yeah, but he's ok now, thank god

- "plugin" architecture made adding new features easy
  - e.g. n-gram, naive bayes, punctuation, word length/message length
learned on training datasets

- results were promising
  - 63% at classification task (baseline 40%, humans 70%)
  - 72% at identification task (baseline 60%, humans 75%)

- hoping to see more work on IM corpora!
