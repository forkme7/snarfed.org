<h3> AIM Away Message Voyeurism </h3>

<p>
In the spirit of George Orwell's <i>1984</i>, I've been
<a href="http://snarfed.org/space/bigbrother"> logging my AIM away messages</a>
for a while. Now that I have a record of them, I want to use them to see how I
spend my time. How much sleep do I <i>really</i> get? Do I work different hours
on different days of the week? Do I <i>always</i> wake up after noon on the
weekends? (Uh, don't answer that.)
</p>
 
<p>
These are recalculated each night at midnight, so what you're seeing is up to
date. You can also see the <a href="http://ryan.barrett.name/away.log"> raw
data</a>, but it's not very interesting. Instead, check out the graphs. They
have pretty colors!

<!-- Lengths -->
<h2><a name="lengths"> Lengths </a></h2>
<p>
<!-- TODO: enter your own description here -->
This shows the total amount of time that has been spent on each away message.

<!-- Layered graphs -->
<h2><a name="layered"> Layered Graphs </a></h2>
<p>
<!-- TODO: enter your own description here -->
These are layered graphs, one for weekdays and one for weekends. They show the
most common away messages, and when they're used, all in the same graph.

<!-- Averages -->
<h2><a name="averages"> Averages </a></h2>
<p>
<!-- TODO: enter your own description here -->
This shows the average duration of each of the away messages. The y axis is
measured in hours.
</p>

messages</a>.

<!-- Frequencies -->
<h2><a name="frequencies"> Frequencies </a></h2>
<p>
<!-- TODO: enter your own description here -->
This shows the frequency of each away message. The y axis shows the number of
times that each away message has been turned on.

<!-- Day Distributions -->
<h2><a name="days"> 24-hour Graphs </a></h2>
<p>
<!-- TODO: enter your own description here -->
These are probability distributions over the 24 hours of the day, one for each
away message. They show the times of the day when each away message is most
likely to be on. The x axis is the time of day, and the y axis is the number of
times that away message has been on at that time of day.

<!-- Week Distributions -->
<h2><a name="weeks"> 7-day Graphs </a></h2>

<p>
<!-- TODO: enter your own title here -->
These are probability distributions over the 7 days of the week for a few away
messages. For each away message, they show on which days of the week that away
message is most likely to be on. The x axis is the day of the week, and the y
axis is the number of hours the away message has been on during that day.
