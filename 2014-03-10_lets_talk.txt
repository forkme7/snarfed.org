I've packaged up and released my first hack from
[IndieWebCamp SF 2014](http://indiewebcamp.com/2014/SF)! [Let's Talk]() is a
[userscript](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) that
renders [h-cards](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card) in a standard format.
When you go to a person's web site, Let's Talk shows you at a glance how to
contact them and which contact methods they prefer.

We live in an app-focused world. When we want to talk to someone, we first have
to choose which app to use. Some people prefer email, others text, others
facetime [or GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpk/self) or a good old phone call.
[Tantek](http://tantek.com/) has argued strongly for moving away from this and
toward a
[people-oriented approach](http://tantek.com/2013/338/b1/people-focused-mobile-communication-experience#mob-comm-2013-12-05),
and he's even
[started designing it](http://tantek.com/2014/067/b2/mockups-people-focused-mobile-communication)
recently. In short, we'd all put h-cards on our web sites with our preferred
contact methods - email addresses, Twitter handles, etc. - and use those to
contact each other.

I'm all for this...except it's not very good for muscle memory. Everyone's web
site looks different. That's great! If you have to parse a different design
every time you want to talk to someone, though, that's not ideal. If we all have
to style our communication methods the same way, that's not ideal either.

[Let's Talk]() fixes this. Everyone can still style their web site however they
want. When you want to talk to someone, just go to their web site, turn on Let's
Talk, and their communication methods appear in the top left corner, in the
order they prefer, with standard icons and styling.

The
[source is on GitHub](https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/master/userscripts/lets_talk.user.js),
and I happily accept pull requests. Thanks to
[Glenn Jones](http://glennjones.net/) for his awesome
[microformat-shiv](http://microformatshiv.com/) library and to
[Automattic](http://automattic.com/) for their great
[Genericons](http://genericons.com/) font. Happy communicating!
