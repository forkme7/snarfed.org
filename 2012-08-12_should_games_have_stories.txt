A debate has raged in the game industry for years.

On one end, people like
[Chris Crawford](http://books.google.com/books?id=_SnhNhcNGr4C) and
[David Cage](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/171004/beyond_heavy_rain_david_cage_on_.php)
argue that storytelling is the highest calling for games, the only one that
matters. On the other end,
[David Jaffe](http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/david-jaffe-wants-to-use-game-play-to-tell-stories-and-he-isnt-afraid-to-fi),
[Tadhg Kelly](http://www.edge-online.com/opinion/opinion-games-cant-tell-stories),
and
[Roger Ebert](http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html)
insist that games' strengths lie elsewhere, and they shouldn't try to tell
stories at all. Mediators like
[Warren Spector](http://www.industrygamers.com/news/warren-spector-on-what-games-should-take-from-various-media/)
and [Ernest Adams](http://www.designersnotebook.com/Columns/columns.htm) try to
make peace, claiming that games should let players create their own stories
through emergence and interactivity.

I think they're all right, every one of them, and I honestly wonder why they
argue. Games are a huge, sprawling medium, every bit as big as books or movies
or music. We have _War and Peace_ and _Fifty Shades of Gray_, _Citizen Kane_ and
_Jackass_, Beethoven and Sir Mixalot. Why would games be any different?

The _Final Fantasy_ series, for example, has a hallowed place in game history,
due in large part to its powerful stories. Decades later, fans still get choked
up when they recall Aeris's death or Sephiroth's treachery.

Likewise, _Tetris_ is a masterpiece of game design, destined to live forever
alongside classic games like chess and poker. _Tetris_ has no more story than
those games, nor does it need one.

There's room for both _Final Fantasy_ and _Tetris_. There's room for _Grand
Theft Auto_ and _Gran Turismo_, _Dungeons and Dragons_ and _Minecraft_, _Angry
Birds_ and _Second Life_. Some have incredible stories, others have none.
Still others build rich backdrops for dramatic theater, vibrant ecosystems
bursting with interconnected life, then hand the reins to the player and say
here, it's your turn, what's your story?

They're all equally valid. Different people have different preferences in games,
a la
[Krpata's taxonomy](http://insultswordfighting.blogspot.com/2008/01/new-taxonomy-of-gamers-table-of.html)
or
[Kelly's four lenses](http://www.edge-online.com/opinion/four-lenses-game-making),
just like different people prefer comedy or action or documentary. That's fine.
Why all the angst?
