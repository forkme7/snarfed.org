Anote Tong, president of low-lying Pacific island nation [Kiribati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiribati), delivers what may be [my favorite climate change talk ever](http://www.ted.com/talks/anote_tong_my_country_will_be_underwater_soon_unless_we_work_together). In place of the usual tropes of rising sea levels, natural disasters, and renewable energy, Tong describes concrete plans to build sea walls, lift buildings onto stilts, and move many of his citizens whose homes will be underwater within years, if not months.



He's strikingly calm and resolute, and way past conservation or even geoengineering. Climate change is irrevocably altering his country *right now*, and he's leading his people to adapt as we speak. They have no other choice. Amazing. Sobering.
