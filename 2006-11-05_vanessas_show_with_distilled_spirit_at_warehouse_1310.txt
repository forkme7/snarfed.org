About a month ago, [Sep Kamvar](http://www.wefeelfine.org/creators.html#sepandar) wandered into my office. He was curious about the [art on the walls](http://vanessaart.com/), which I'd stolen fair and square from [my sister](http://vanessaart.com/). I gave him her card, went back to work, and promptly forgot about the encounter...

...until Vanessa announced her next show, a collaboration with Sep's independent clothing line, [Distilled Spirit](http://distilledspirit.com/). He's always on the lookout for local artists to work with, and Vanessa was happy to oblige. Cool!

I spread the word, and promised the [friday dinner](/friday_mexican_dinner) crew a real, honest-to-God taqueria in the Mission if they came to the show. We grabbed dinner at [Taqueria San Francisco](http://www.burritophile.com/place.php?id=73), which had damn good burritos, even though they were out of their signature dish, [buche](http://www.burritoblog.com/2006/04/buche_yummy_pig.html).

Undeterred, I led the way down the street to [Warehouse 1310](http://warehouse1310.com/), where the show was already in full swing. Sep and crew did an admirable job of making a raw, empty warehouse look edgy and cool with just a few touches here and there. Vanessa's art looked great, and the clothes and other art did too.

[Dan's post](http://kodiak.brainymonkey.com/index.php/2006/11/03/multimedia-message-53/) has pictures and more details. Vanessa, Sep, everyone, thanks for a great party!
