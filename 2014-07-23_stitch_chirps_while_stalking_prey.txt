Stitch chirps while stalking a hummingbird

Stitch and Marley often make little chirping noises when they're watching a bird
or a squirrel, but this is the first time I've caught a good video of it.
[Wikipedia says this is common.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_communication#Chirr)
I say it's pretty damn funny.
