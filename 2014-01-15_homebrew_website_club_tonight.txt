There's been a lot of talk lately about how the
[slow death
of PCs](http://www.wired.com/business/2014/01/death-pc-also-mean-end-web/) and the
[rise of apps](http://www.zdnet.com/the-mobile-web-is-dead-long-live-the-app-7000024786/)
mean the
[writing is on the wall for blogs](http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/12/the-blog-is-dead/),
and maybe even for the web as a whole.

I won't try to predict the future, but many of us
[still love](http://www.zeldman.com/2013/12/11/this-is-a-website/)
[the web](http://www.onebigfluke.com/2012/07/focusing-on-positives-why-i-have-my-own.html)
[and think it](http://werd.io/2013/the-blog-might-be-dying-but-the-webs-about-to)
[has a future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve48PjgDAn0),
[including me](/2012-07-25_why_i_have_my_own_web_site). We're
actively trying to push it forward, too, [adding](https://www.brid.gy/)
[many](http://indiewebcamp.com/event)
[features](http://indiewebcamp.com/feed_reader) social networks and apps
got right and

[many](http://indiewebcamp.com/indieauth)
[more](http://indiewebcamp.com/site-deaths) they may have gotten wrong.

[This is what Homebrew Website Club is all about.](http://tantek.com/2013/322/b1/homebrew-computer-club-reunion-inspiration)
If it sounds up your alley, join us! We meet every other Wednesday, so if you
can't make it tonight, come next time. I'll be hosting in SF at the
[Quip](http://quip.com/)
[office](/2013-06-04_new-office-decor), and local chapters
beyond Portland are popping up too, including NYC and
[London](http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-01-14/line/1389690247). Hope to see
you there!
