[IndieWebCamp SF](http://indiewebcamp.com/2014/SF) is next Friday and Saturday.
I can't wait! I'm more excited than I have been for a conference in a long time.
If you're around, you should join us!

If you love the richness of social networks and the power of apps, but you want
to own your relationships and data and your presence online, then IndieWebCamp
is for you. Space is limited, and we plan to spend more time making than
talking, but don't let that stop you. Just add yourself to the
[guest list](http://indiewebcamp.com/2014/SF_Guest_List) and show up Friday
morning!

(If you're not in the Bay Area, there are
[lots of other #indieweb events](http://indiewebcamp.com/events) around the
world. There's also
[Homebrew Website Club](http://tantek.com/2013/332/b1/homebrew-website-club-newsletter),
which meets
[every other Wednesday](http://indiewebcamp.com/events/2014-02-26-homebrew-website-club)
in a growing number of places.)
