I use [Ion](http://iki.fi/~tuomov/ion/) as my window manager, and I love it. It's written by [Tuomo Valkonen](http://iki.fi/~tuomov/), who says it's _a tiling tabbed window manager designed with keyboard users in mind._ I just say it rocks.

The [Ion web site](http://iki.fi/~tuomov/ion/), [FAQ](http://iki.fi/~tuomov/ion/faq.html), [wiki](http://wiki.ael.be/ion/), and [mailing list](https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/ion-general) cover all the bases, so I don't have anything new to add to them. However, I've posted my [workspace and config files](/dotfiles). Enjoy!
