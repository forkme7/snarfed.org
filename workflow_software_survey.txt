I recently did some research at [work](/2010-03-13_new_job) on existing
libraries, frameworks, and tools for managing semi-automated workflows
and pipelines of tasks. Here's a survey of many of them.

There are a number of loose, overlapping terms for these kinds of systems: BPM
(business process management), workflow, pipeline, flowchart, state machine,
visual programming, dataflow, flow-based programming, dependency management,
task management, etc. They're useful for web searches, even if not a lot more.

In practice, they tend to fall into a few broad categories that don't overlap
too much:

  * *BPM.* These are primarily people-based, ie each stage usually corresponds
    to something a human needs to do. Examples include CRM, bug/issue tracking,
    ticketing, approval chain, and document management.
  * *Data processing.* These are primarily data based, usually for large
    datasets or streaming data sources. Examples include web search indexing,
    ETL (extract/transform load) for data warehouses, MapReduce/Hadoop, and other large scale
    data pipelines.
  * *<code>make</code> style.* These are individually driven, batch automation pipelines.
    They're kicked off manually and focus more on the workflow itself than the
    data. Unlike BPM, individual stages are often automated.
  * *Visual programming.* Let non-programmers draw boxes and arrows that become a computer program. People have been building these systems for decades! Examples include Squeak, Yahoo Pipes, Hypercard (old school!), maybe Visual Basic, etc.

Also, here are a few of the many standards:

  * [XPDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPDL): XML Process
  Definition Language, a
  [Workflow Management Coalition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow_Management_Coalition)
  standard.
  * [Wf-XML](http://www.wfmc.org/wfmc-wf-xml.html), a
  [Workflow Management Coalition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow_Management_Coalition)
  standard.
  * [BPEL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPEL) (Business Process
  Execution Language), an [OASIS](http://www.oasis-open.org/)
  standard.
  * [YAWL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAWL)
  (Yet Another Workflow Language). Supported by the
  [YAWL foundation](http://www.yawlfoundation.org/) and the
  [Workflow Patterns initiative](http://www.workflowpatterns.com/).


I focused on open source Python projects here, but even so, this is nowhere near
comprehensive. There are _tons_ more out there. See Wikipedia's
[Comparison of BPEL engines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BPEL_engines),
among many others.
