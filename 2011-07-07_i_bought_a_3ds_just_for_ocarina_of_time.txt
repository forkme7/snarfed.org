I bought a 3DS just for <i>Ocarina of Time</i>

...and so far I don't regret it.

_[Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time](http://www.metacritic.com/game/nintendo-64/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time)_
is widely considered the best game of all time -
[Edge](http://www.next-gen.biz/features/edges-top-100-games-all-time?page=10),
[GameRankings](http://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html),
[Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/game/nintendo-64/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time) -
and yet I've never played it. It came out over a decade ago, long before I
bought my first game consoles. I tried to play it in an emulator once, but it
didn't work too well.

I looked through my [to play list](/games) the other day, and all of the games on
it were still in development. I moved on to recent top-rated Android and iOS
games, which I tend to neglect. I almost bought
[GameLoft](http://www.gameloft.com/)'s
_[Sacred Odyssey](http://www.gameloft.com/ipad-games/knight-odyssey/)_, an
unabashed Zelda ripoff alongside their unlicensed "remakes" of other classic
games like _Halo_ and _Starcraft_. They're all well executed, if unoriginal, and
I do love me some Zelda.

That got me thinking, though. Why play a ripoff when _Ocarina_ is
[remastered and playable on 3DS](http://www.zelda.com/ocarina3d/)? Well, because
I don't have a 3DS, and I wouldn't play much else on it. Hmm...but would I spend
$300 for _Ocarina_ alone? One of the best games of all time, if not the best?
Well, when you put it that way, yes, I would.

A week later, I'm still happy I did it. _Ocarina_ is great. And hey, look,
[eShop](http://www.nintendo.com/3ds/downloads)! Ok, it's weak, but it does have
software. I'll happily buy and play [Cave Story](http://www.cavestory.org/), and
some [BIT.TRIP](http://www.bittripgame.com/) games, and who knows what else. So
yes, it's still basically $300 for one game, but there's a little gravy too.

Sometimes quality is worth every penny. Happy gaming!

P.S. I played through half of
[SuperBrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP](http://www.swordandsworcery.com/) too. I
like it so far. The pixellated hipster look isn't my thing, but it's patterned
after old school adventure games, which I love, and damn if it doesn't have some
great ambiance. Also, it's 1/60th what I paid for _Ocarina_.
