I've released version 0.5 of [bigbrother](/bigbrother), a program that
generates statistics and graphs about your IM away messages. Highlights from
this version include "layered" graphs, graph smoothing, and optional start and
end dates. The smoothing alone is worth upgrading for; it makes the graphs look
_much_ better. [Check it out!](/ryan.barrett.name/bigbrother/)
