Revisiting <i>Why I&#39;m weird about privacy</i>

Since I wrote
_[Why I'm weird about privacy](/2011-08-03_why_im_weird_about_privacy)_ over a
year ago, it's become one of the more unusual things I've published here.

My posts generally break down into three buckets: useful
[information](/privacy_through_prepaid_credit_cards), light personal
[trifles](/2012-08-20_hello_anaphylaxis), and heavy, thoughtful
[essays](/2012-08-15_if_theres_no_free_will_then_what).
_[Why I'm weird](/2011-08-03_why_im_weird_about_privacy)_ had a bit of each, and
it generated a similarly mixed response. Strangers discussed it online more than
friends, but friends asked about it offline more than my other essays, and they
engaged with the practical info and tips just as much as the deeper ideas,
assuming it had any to begin with.

I enjoyed writing it, and when I re-read it now, it holds up: I'm still
weird in all the same ways. However, the world itself is changing. Online
privacy concerns loom ever larger in the public consciousness, including
[behavioral tracking](http://springload.com/2012/03/03/the-real-reason-consumers-are-creeped-out-by-online-ads/),
[re-identification](http://epic.org/privacy/reidentification/#intro), and the
lopsided
[balance of power](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57470750-83/how-google-products-go-from-creepy-to-cool/)
we feel information-rich companies like Google and Facebook hold over us. Europe
is leading the push for a
["right to be forgotten"](http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/privacy-paradox/right-to-be-forgotten),
a seductively compelling idea that unfortunately may raise more questions than
it answers.

There may not be many truly new ideas, but the volume is definitely getting
louder, and I've enjoyed the newfound attention to privacy and big data from
researchers across many fields. Here are a few standouts:

* [Daniel Solove](http://www.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/), a law professor at
  [GWU](http://www.law.gwu.edu), has been a leading thinker on privacy and law
  for decades. His book
  [Nothing to Hide](http://books.google.com/books?id=YlQmcgAACAAJ), based on his
  academic work, thrusts privacy forward as a cornerstone of healthy civil
  society, something to be promoted for its wide ranging benefits and not just
  defended to pacify a few hand-wringing luddites.

* Information theorists have demolished any hope of digging ourselves out of
  these holes with
  [de-identification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-identification) alone.
  [Cynthia Dwork](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/dwork/)'s
  _[Differential Privacy](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_sdt=1,5&q=%22Differential+Privacy%22+%22Cynthia+Dwork%22&hl=en&as_vis=1)_
  in particular has emerged as a crushing
  [incompleteness theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems),
  proving that true de-identification is impossible in any formal sense.

* People from academia and industry are not only
  [talking about](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=%22Engineering+Privacy+in+an+Age+of+Information+Abundance%22&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp=)
  privacy and big data, they're
  [actually listening](http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/privacy-paradox/big-data)
  to each other. I've appreciated the newly explicit tradeoff between privacy and
  public goods that come from data mining, such as medical research, governance
  reform, and tackling climate change. When we look at these questions as
  tradeoffs, and honestly weigh all sides, we're more likely to land in a
  halfway decent place.

On a lighter note,
<a class="shutter" href="/scufflechuck_check.jpg">my new checks</a>
came in the mail yesterday! I've been gradually moving accounts from my name to
my LLC's, and the financial services are easily the most critical. I'm just a
few steps away from closing the accounts in my name entirely. I'll soon be able
now move money around without any visible connection to my name, address, or any
other
[PII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information). Woot!

Don't get too complacent out there. You might be the next friend I convince to
[start a shady LLC](http://www.trollololmotorcars.com/) or
[hide your movements](http://snarfed.org/2011-08-03_why_im_weird_about_privacy#comment-76518).
Mwahahahaha...
