Half Dome

One weekend in July, [Ken](https://profiles.google.com/kashcraft), Ken's parents, Tina, Peter, and I hiked to the top of [Half Dome](http://www.yosemitefun.com/halfdome.htm) in [Yosemite](http://www.nps.gov/yose/). It's a grueling, all-day, 12-hour hike. Including the trailhead, it's about 19 miles round trip and 4800 feet of elevation gain. The hardest mile is the one straight up. Still, even though we couldn't walk right for _days_ after, we had a lot of fun.
