We went to see [Mortified](http://www.getmortified.com/about/) a few nights ago
at [DNA Lounge](http://www.dnalounge.com/), and we really enjoyed it. It's one
of the many live storytelling shows inspired by the likes of
[The Moth](http://themoth.org/about). The storytellers read verbatim from
diaries, letters, and other artifacts from their childhood and adolescence.
Topics included first love, celebrity crushes, relationships with parents, and
gay people struggling to come out.

One of the best parts of the show was Mortified's resident band
[The Freeze](http://www.thefreezesf.com/), which reprised the highlights of each
reading with a freestyle rap. They were hilarious.

If it sounds like your kind of thing,
[check out more videos](http://www.getmortified.com/recess/videos/) and

February 8th, and they perform all over the US.
