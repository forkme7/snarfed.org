Zoooooo

I'd just like to plug some of my shots of the
[San Diego Zoo](http://maulik.freeshell.net/Miki.pl?page=San+Diego+Zoo.miki).

While I'm at it, I'd like to show you
[Stanford](http://maulik.freeshell.net/Miki.pl?page=Stanford+Campus+Album.miki) the way it
was meant to be seen....from high above, with a slight fish-eye effect.
