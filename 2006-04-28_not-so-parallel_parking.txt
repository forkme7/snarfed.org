A friend of mine saw an..._interesting_ traffic accident in San Francisco the
other day. Click on the picture for a larger version.

Here's his account:

> I saw this last Sunday at Filmore and California in SF. The woman who did it
> (standing in the far right) said she'd been looking for parking, got frustrated,
> then saw this spot and 'gunned it' to get it before someone else. There was a
> large crowd gathered, mostly laughing. The cops even laughed a bit. The
> tow-truck guy laughed.
>
> What blows my mind is that the car was not damaged except for hitting the
> parking meter. The untold part is what happened when the tow truck got there.
> The guy just hooked a chain to the front of the top car and pulled hard. The top
> car came off, and it tore off the front part of the car beneath (which had until
> then exhibited no damage other than a dent where the top car rested on it).
>
> The kicker is that the top car emerged from it unscathed. It bounced to the
> ground and someone got in and drove off. The bottom car was a disaster.

> Cheers
