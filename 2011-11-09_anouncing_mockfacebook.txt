Announcing mockfacebook

Recently, while researching a
[side project](/2011-07-27_facebook_app_for_ostatus), I started looking at the
[Facebook APIs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/). I was surprised that I
couldn't find a decent library for mocking or faking
[FQL](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/) or the
[Graph API](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/). Everyone just
uses live Facebook to test, sometimes even in unit tests!

A few thousand lines of code later, I had a little utility to fill that void.
[mockfacebook](https://github.com/rogerhu/mockfacebook) is a standalone HTTP
server that implements Facebook's FQL and Graph API. It's particularly useful
for automated integration testing. It's backed by a [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/)
database, which you can seed from Facebook or populate manually or
programmatically.

Feedback is welcome!
