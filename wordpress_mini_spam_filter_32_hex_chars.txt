WordPress mini spam filter for comments ending in 32 hex characters

For a while now, pretty much every spam comment that's made it past my WordPress
spam filter plugins, [Akismet](https://akismet.com/) and JS-based
[Stop Spam Comments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-spam-comments/), has
ended in a random, 32-digit hex string. For example:

> Taken with a GoPro Hero 3 Black, the photo records the tips of the communityâ€™s highest structures jabbing through dense cloud. 4c615976ebb5b573d4b6343094660d05

I don't know why this is, but my guess is that the spammers keep a database of
all of these strings and the sites they sent them to and Google for them later
to see which spam comments survived and which didn't.

Here's a tiny PHP snippet you can add to your theme's `functions.php` that will
automatically mark comments like these as spam:

    function spam_32_hex_chars($approved, $commentdata) {
      $text = trim(wp_strip_all_tags($commentdata['comment_content'], true));
      return preg_match('|[0-9a-f]{32}$|', $text) ? 'spam' : $approved;
    }
    
    add_filter('pre_comment_approved', 'spam_32_hex_chars', '99', 2);

Happy blogging!
