[Protocol specification](/p4protocol)_  

P4 is a fully functional, self-organizing overlay network similar to
[Gnutella](http://rfc-gnutella.sourceforge.net/) and
[Freenet](http://freenet.sf.net/). However, P4 differs in that it provides an
API for developing applications on top of the overlay. P4 handles the networking
and peering and exports functionality for unicast, multicast, user and plugin
discovery, and strong encryption and authentication. This frees developers from
worrying about networking, and allows them to focus on building real
functionality.

Since its release in early 2001, P4 has been surpassed by other general-purpose
overlay platforms such as [JXTA](http://jxta.org/),
[Groove](http://groove.net/), and Microsoft's
[Windows Peer-to-Peer SDK](/windows_p2p). Furthermore,
[many](http://overnet.com/) [other](http://freedom.net/)
[file](http://freehaven.net/) [sharing](http://mnet.sourceforge.net/)
[networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastTrack) have long been superior to P4
in terms of routing algorithms, bandwidth management, anonymity, maturity, etc.
(They're mostly dedicated file-sharing networks, though, not general-purpose
networks.)

For these reasons, P4 is not as competitive or relevant now as it was then.
However, it may still be viable if you're looking for a simple, lightweight,
embeddable networking solution. P4 requires only
[Berkeley sockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets) and
[pthreads](http://www.llnl.gov/computing/tutorials/workshops/workshop/pthreads/MAIN.html),
and the shared library weighs in at a slim 270K.

P4 has been tested on RedHat 9, SUSE 8, Debian stable, Solaris/SunOS 5.8, and
Mac OS X. It should build on most \*nix platforms without much modification.
Windows Visual Studio project files are included for building on Windows, but
they're not currently maintained.
