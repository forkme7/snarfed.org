Biotech is all the rage these days. Consumer health products like Fitbit have
staked out one end, larger-than-life projects like
[Craig Venter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Venter)'s capture imaginations
and press cycles on the other, and an endless array of startups, big pharma, and
research foundations fill the middle to bursting. Sequencing genomes is sexy.
Folding proteins, stimulating neurons, and hunting superbugs are all sexy.

Even so, the project I've been me most excited about recently isn't a startup, a
new product, or a resesarch breakthrough. It's a government bureacracy, working
on compliance, using billing data. No joke.

OK, that's a bit unfair. It does at least have a Hollywood-ominous name:
[Mini-Sentinel](http://www.mini-sentinel.org/).
[NPR did a great overview recently](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/07/21/332290342/big-data-peeps-at-your-medical-records-to-find-drug-problems),
but in short, it's an FDA project that mines
[anonymized(ish)](/2012-09-22_revisiting_why_im_weird_about_privacy#dwork)
medical records from 180M Americans to discover unexpected drug side effects and
behaviors.

It's a noble goal, but admittedly, it's pretty straightforward big data. What
gets me excited is, of all things, the bureacracy. Doctors and medical
researchers have salivated at these kinds of meta-analyses for decades, but the
data has always been tied up in a straitjacket of regulation, liability, and
trade secrecy FUD. Big providers like Kaiser and the VA have enough data to do
similar kinds of projects entirely on their own, internally, but this is one of
the first I've seen that combines so much data from so many different sources.

It's far from perfect, of course. The data itself is mainly billing codes, the
only somewhat standard format available, which was never meant for medical
research. The methodology and results are still immature. Still, it's a big deal.

At a higher level, Mini-Sentinel illustrates what I
[and others](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/new_book_on_dat.html)
think may be the next defining question for our generation: _how do we balance
the individual's right to
[privacy and control over their data](/2011-08-03_why_im_weird_about_privacy)
with society's need to use it for the public good?_

Medical records have always skewed toward the individual. Positive results from
projects like Mini-Sentinel may erode that, but laws like HIPAA and patients'
(perfectly valid!) expectations of privacy will make progress slow and halting.

Other fields, notably advertising and more recently national security, have
skewed toward the group's rights.
[The US has never enjoyed clear data privacy protection, unlike the EU](/us_privacy_law),
so credit bureaus and online ad networks have run rampant in recent history, and
Snowden showed us that the NSA has largely ignored the 4th Amendment altogether
in its epic, 9/11-fueled land (and budget) grab.

Elsewhere, the waters are murky. Google's web search, for example, is a public
good that's essential for most of us on a daily basis, but the EU has
strong-armed it recently with a
[Right to forget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten) doctrine
for individuals. Similarly, Google's
[environmental](https://earthengine.google.org/)
[map](http://www.google.com/earth/explore/showcase/ocean.html)
[projects](http://www.google.org/flutrends/) are
powerful forces for positive change, but
[Street View](https://www.google.com/maps/views/streetview) also blurs faces and
license plates and sometimes more to protect people's privacy.

I'm particularly fascinated to see how we (re)think public spaces in the near
future. US courts have consistently protected photographs and audio recordings
from streets and other places with free right of way,
["semi-public" spaces notwithstanding](/2012-01-29_popos_tour), but I don't
expect that to last forever.
[Drones may deliver our packages soon](http://ahistoryofthefuture.org/ucs-deliverbot/),
but they can also hover outside our windows and record video, eventually
straight through curtains. (Hello, TSA backscatter scanners!)

This is nothing less than the
[tragedy of the commons in reverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).
Everyone loves an underdog, and right now the underdog is individual privacy,
under threat from big bad corporations and governments. I worry that our
bloodlust for individual privacy and data rights may end up muzzling important,
worthy projects like Mini-Sentinel. On the other hand, I also worry about our
ongoing failure to reign in power-thirsty behemoths like the NSA, credit
bureaus, and ad networks, and provide meaningful privacy rights for individuals.

The silver lining is that we're all talking about it. We may not be framing the
question quite the way I'd like, as a balance between individual and group
rights, but that's ok. It's not going away anytime soon.
