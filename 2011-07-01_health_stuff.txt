Health stuff

[My dad](http://one-one.net/team.htm) says you know you're old when all you talk
about is the weather and your health. Well, maybe I'm getting old, but it's hot
here, and I'm about to write about my health.

Don't worry! I'm fine. I've been lucky to be healthy my whole life. I've never
had surgery or any other major procedure, and I see doctors rarely enough that
even routine things seem new and interesting. In the last half a year, though,
I've found some great new solutions to common problems:
[neti pot](http://www.webmd.com/allergies/sinus-pain-pressure-9/neti-pots)
 for sinus infections, [The Stick](http://www.thestick.com/) for
neck strain, and
[mid-foot striking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait_%28human%29#Foot_strike)
for
[runner's knee](http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/knee-pain/runners-knee).

I've been prone to sinus infections my whole life. My usual approach was to stay
home, wait it out, and take antibiotics if necessary. They gradually got more
frequent, though, so I finally went to
[an ENT](http://sfotomed.com/dr-kim-otolaryngology-medical-group-bay-area-ca.html).
A [CT scan](/ct_scan_images_and_animations) showed her that my sinuses were
normal size and shape, so she recommended
[saline rinses](http://www.webmd.com/allergies/sinus-pain-pressure-9/neti-pots),
ie neti pot, before anything more drastic. I tried it, quickly graduated to the
["positive pressure" squeeze bottle version](http://www.sinucleanse.com/product/backwash.htm),
and haven't had a sinus infection since! One down, two to go.

Around the same time, I stopped [running](/2006-02-01_running_maps) due to pain
in my left knee. It developed gradually over years, only while running, and
finally got bad enough that I couldn't run more than a half mile. A doctor
quickly diagnosed it as
[patello-femoral syndrome](http://www.aafp.org/afp/991101ap/2012.html), aka
runner's knee. Sigh.

A physical therapist checked me out and found two problems: too much impact from
[heel-striking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait_%28human%29#Foot_strike) and
weak obliques. She helped me change my form, prescribed strength-building
exercises and stretches, and a month later I was back up to my normal five mile
run. Two down, only one left!

My knee wasn't my only low grade, chronic problem. I'd always paid attention to
ergonomics, but even so, my neck had gradually stiffened over the last couple
years until it was uncomfortably tight and strained. It didn't help that I've
slept [on my stomach, the worst possible way](http://www.neckpainsupport.com/2009/05/which-sleeping-position-is-the-best-for-you.html),
for my whole life.

My doctor diagnosed "monitor neck" due to sitting in a static position for long
periods of time. I started stretching, switched to sleeping on my side and back,
and attacked my neck muscles with [The Stick](http://www.thestick.com/), which
relaxes them and works out knots and kinks. It's working well so far.

I was a bit fascinated by all this. Other than a common cold here and a minor
trauma there, I've been very healthy. I'd never really had the experience of
having something go wrong with my body, seeing a doctor, and getting it fixed.
Modern medicine is all well and good, but it was a pleasant surprise to find low
tech, non-medical solutions to these problems that actually worked.
