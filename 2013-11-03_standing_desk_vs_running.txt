Standing desk vs running

I went for a run on Saturday, my first since my
[runner's knee](/2011-07-01_health_stuff#runners-knee) came
back half a year ago. My legs were out of shape, and I had to stop a couple
times, but my knee lasted the whole way. It felt good to be back in the saddle.

I suspect it flared up again because I switched to a
[standing desk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_desk) a while back. I
started feeling it on runs soon after the switch, but it wasn't until walking
started triggering it too, and then even just standing, that I connected the
dots. I switched back to
[sitting on a ball](http://lifehacker.com/5830748/why-i-switched-my-office-chair-with-an-exercise-ball-and-what-it-feels-like),
and a month later I was running again.

I am a bit disappointed. I really enjoyed the standing desk, and I appreciated
that I wasn't sitting all day. I might be able to compromise and stand some of
the time, but my desk at work isn't easily adjustable, so I'll have to put that
on hold for now. I'm glad I tried the standing desk, but I'm even more glad I
can run again. See you on the road!
