I'm slow

Speed is all the rage these days. [Move fast and break things](),
[iterate as fast as you can](), [fail fast]() and [learn fast]() from your
mistake and [pivot fast]() so you can do it all over again. We scorn bloated
governments and dinosaur bureacracies and praise
[lean startups](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) and lightweight
crowdsourced crowds. We crow that even the rate of change itself is speeding up,
citing [internet time]() when we marvel that the smartphones and social networks
we take for granted didn't exist five or ten years ago.

That's all well and good, but it doesn't fit me personally. I don't move fast.
There's pretty much nothing I'm naturally quick at besides running and
athletics. (OK, and maybe eating.) Left to my own devices, I don't work fast,
play fast, think fast, or talk fast. I'm notorious for circling back hours or
days after a meeting with new ideas. I _definitely_ don't
[context switch](/2013-05-31_fighting-information-overload-and-beyond) fast; on
the contrary, I often try to postpone context switching at all.

I blame some of my sloth, and the proverbial fires under many of my friends'
butts, on the genetic lottery and personal preference. People have a wide range
of natural speeds. As with most things, you can practice and gradually speed up
or slow down relative to your baseline, but you're stuck with your baseline.

I wouldn't even recommend diverging too far from your baseline. It might be
useful temporarily, but I expect people who try go too fast for too long end up
burning out, and I'm sure they sacrifice some quality along the way. Likewise,
if you slow yourself down for too long, or you're constantly blocked from making
progress, you'll eventually lose interest and motivation.

So why, especially in our tech, startup, and creative communities, do we worship
at the altar of speed? Why does fast and broken seem better than slow and
working?

There are plenty of reasons, and most of them are probably valid. First, instant
gratification is powerful. No one likes to wait. Second, it's simply _possible_
to move faster now than we used to. Technology has streamlined, democratized,
and otherwise accelerated many tasks that used to take more time, especially
around making things. Also, our business environment and stock markets are
designed to reward growth, progress, first- and second-mover advantage, and all
sorts of other factors that directly depend on momentum.

Finally, those of us who design and build products (and services, creative
works, and other projects), now largely agree that iteration is the key to
success. If you want to end up with something people like, your best bet is to
take a quick first stab at it, put that in front of people, make them use it and
give you real feedback, incorporate that feedback, and repeat. It's possible make
something great without iterating, but it's the exception, not the rule.

I go so far as to say your chances depend more on the number of iterations than
anything else. It's not an original idea; many others have argued this for
years,
[including Eric Ries](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/cash-is-not-king.html).
It follows that if you want to build something good faster, and you can't cut
down the number of iterations, you have to speed up the iteration cycle itself.
