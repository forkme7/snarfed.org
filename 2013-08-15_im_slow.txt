I'm slow

Speed is all the rage these days.
[Move fast and break things](http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2012/02/01/facebooks-hacker-way-move-fast-and-break-things/),
[iterate fast](http://softwaredev.quora.com/When-in-Doubt-Iterate-Faster),
[fail fast](http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgebradt/2013/01/23/want-to-fail-fast-do-these-three-things/)
and
[learn fast](http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2011/11/28/fail-fast-how-startups-can-learn-from-their-mistakes/)
from your mistake and
[pivot fast](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672580/5-ways-big-companies-can-pivot-like-lean-startups)
so you can do it all over again. We scorn bloated governments and dinosaur
bureacracies and praise [lean startups](http://theleanstartup.com/principles)
and lightweight crowdsourced crowds. We crow that even the rate of change itself
is speeding up, citing
[internet time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_time) when we marvel that
the smartphones and social networks we take for granted didn't exist five or ten
years ago.

That's all well and good, but it doesn't fit me personally. I don't move fast.
There's pretty much nothing I'm naturally quick at besides running and
athletics. (OK, and maybe eating.) Left to my own devices, I don't work fast,
play fast, think fast, or talk fast. I'm notorious for circling back hours or
days after a meeting with new ideas. I _definitely_ don't
[context switch](/2013-05-31_fighting-information-overload-and-beyond) fast; on
the contrary, I often try to postpone context switching at all.

I blame some of my sloth, and the proverbial fires under many of my friends'
butts, on the genetic lottery and personal preference. People have a wide range
of natural speeds. As with most things, you can practice and gradually speed up
or slow down relative to your baseline, but you're stuck with your baseline.

I wouldn't even recommend diverging too far from your baseline. It might be
useful temporarily, but I expect people who try go too fast for too long end up
burning out, and I'm sure they sacrifice some quality along the way. Likewise,
if you slow yourself down for too long, or you're constantly blocked from making
progress, you'll eventually lose interest and motivation.

So why, especially in our tech, startup, and creative communities, do we worship
at the altar of speed? Why does fast and broken seem better than slow but
working?

There are plenty of reasons, and most of them are probably valid. First, instant
gratification is powerful. No one likes to wait. Second, it's simply _possible_
to move faster now than we used to. Technology has streamlined, democratized,
and otherwise accelerated many tasks that used to take more time, especially
around making things. Also, our business environment and stock markets are
designed to reward growth, progress, first- and second-mover advantage, and all
sorts of other factors that directly depend on momentum.

Finally, those of us who design and build products (and services, creative
works, and other projects), now largely agree that iteration is the key to
success. If you want to end up with something people like, your best bet is to
take a quick first stab at it, put that in front of people, make them use it and
give you real feedback, incorporate that feedback, and repeat. It's possible make
something great without iterating, but it's the exception, not the rule.

I go so far as to say your chances depend more on the number of iterations than
anything else. It's not an original idea; many others have argued this for
years,
[including Eric Ries](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/cash-is-not-king.html).
It follows that if you want to build something good faster, and you can't cut
down the number of iterations, you have to cut down the time you spend on each
iteration. Unfortunately, we're now squarely in circular logic land. To move
faster, you have to move faster.

There are still silver linings though. The accepted wisdom for startups isn't
"enough iterations," it's "move faster." Enough iterations isn't exactly a
killer war cry, granted, but it has the benefit of actually being right, or at
least more right than just moving fast. If you don't try to move faster than you
can sustain, but you understand how to iterate for real (e.g. getting _real_
feedback from _external users_), you'll probably beat the companies that are
running themselves ragged without knowing where they're going.

On another note, if you're doing anything at all creative,
[research](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/science/18angier.html)
[has](http://www.crackingthelearningcode.com/element31.html)
[concluded](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/325/5940/621.abstract) that stress is your kryptonite. When you're under stress of any
kind, your brain tenses up, cuts off precious oxygen from the higher level
speculative regions - where creativity, learning, and all sorts of other
valuable abilities live - and doubles down on fight or flight responses in your
amygdala. The conclusion is clear: if you're doing something creative, don't
stress yourself out by moving faster than you're comfortable with.

This is all relative to your baseline, of course! If you run faster than the
average, the world may be a bit too slow for you. If you love the adrenaline
rush you get from working on a deadline, or you come alive when you're
firefighting an emergency, the right kind of stress might just be good for you.
For the rest of us, though, stress often does more harm than good. It's the
reason why the long hours of crunch mode
[usually result in _lower_ productivity](http://www.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons)
over the long term, not higher.

My expectations here are modest. I'm not trying to overturn our speed fetish,
or to scold people who enjoy moving fast. As with most of my posts here, this is
more introspection than anything else. I know my baseline is slower than
average, and writing about it helps me explore the details and implications. I
[may work at a fast-moving startup](/2013-07-30_introducing_quip.txt) right now,
but who knows. I might slow down to the stately, glacial pace of academia in my
next job. Or maybe I'll just retire altogether and play golf. I'll keep you posted.
