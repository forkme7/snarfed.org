I've posted the
[slides](/transactions_across_datacenters_io.html)
from a talk I gave recently at
[USF](http://usf.edu/):
[Transactions Across Datacenters](/transactions_across_datacenters_io.html).
[Benjamin Wells](http://www.usfca.edu/artsci/fac_staff/W/wells_benjamin.html)
invited me to speak as part of the
[Special Lecture Series in Computer Science](http://web.cs.usfca.edu/courses).

Here's the abstract:

> If you work on distributed systems, you probably try to design your system
> to keep running if any single machine fails. If you're ambitious, you
> might extend this to entire racks, or even more inconvenient sets of
> machines. However, what if your entire datacenter falls off the face of
> the earth?
>
> This talk will examine how current large scale storage systems handle
> fault tolerance and consistency, with a particular focus on popular cloud
> computing platforms. We'll cover techniques such as replication, sharding,
> two phase commit, and consensus protocols (e.g. Paxos), then explore how
> they can be applied across datacenters.

Feedback is welcome!
