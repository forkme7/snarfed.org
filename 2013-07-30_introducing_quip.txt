Introducing Quip

<p class="right half">
 <a href="https://quip.com/"><img class="shadow" src="/quip_wordmark.jpg" /></a></p>

When I [left Google](/2013-02-27_leaving_google) half a year ago for a startup,
I couldn't tell you what we were doing...but now I can! We're excited to
announce our new product, [Quip](https://quip.com/). It's a modern word
processor that lets you create beautiful documents on all of your devices -
phone, tablet, and desktop - by focusing on collaboration, mobility,
interactivity, and simplicity.

Check out [our blog post](https://quip.com/blog/introducing-quip) and the
[New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/technology/as-work-habits-change-software-makers-rush-to-innovate.html).
More importantly, please give it a try! It's free for personal use; just
[install the iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quip/id647922896) or
[sign up on the web](https://quip.com/). We also have a
[preview Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quip.quip),
if you already have an account and you're willing to tolerate some quirks.

Going to a small startup was a change after so long at Google, but it's been
great so far. Most of us had
[worked together before](/2008-04-07_google_app_engine_launched), so we shared a
common culture, not to mention valuable experience from
[past startups](http://friendfeed.com/). Oh, and
[our office is awesome](/2013-06-04_new-office-decor).

On the technical side, I've been a bit of a mercenary. I've worked on every part
of the codebase: the server and storage system, data model, synchronization
protocol, [web frontend](https://quip.com/),
[iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quip/id647922896), and
[Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quip.quip). I
had to learn lots of new things in short order, often overnight, which was
challenging at times but always worthwhile.

On a related note, Google's CEOs may have scored points with the code
[they used](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt#Biography)
[to write](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page#Early_life_and_education),
but I love that Quip is small enough that [Bret](http://backchannel.org/about)
and [Kevin](http://www.kevgibbs.com/about) _still_ spend most of their time
writing code. Not a bad sign.

In any case, I'm excited for you all to [try it out](https://quip.com/). Enjoy,
and let us know what you think!
