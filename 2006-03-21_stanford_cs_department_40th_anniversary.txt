Stanford CS Department 40th Anniversary

<a href="http://forum.stanford.edu/forty/"><img src="/stanford_cs_40.jpg"></a>

I just got back from the Stanford [Computer Science
department](http://cs.stanford.edu/)'s [40th
Anniversary](http://forum.stanford.edu/forty/). It was both a seminar and a
networking event, featuring professors emeritus from years past, current
professors, and distinguished alumni. They waxed nostalgic about the CS dept. in
the "good old days" and they discussed the current state of Stanford CS research
and industry relations.

[Hector Garcia-Molina](http://forum.stanford.edu/research/profile.php?id=1800)
led the panels, and [John
Hennessy](http://forum.stanford.edu/research/profile.php?id=1998) keynoted. The
panels included a number of huge names, most of which I've listed below. The
crowd almost outshined them, though. People like [Whitfield
Diffie](http://research.sun.com/people/diffie/), [Vint
Cerf](http://www.icann.org/biog/cerf.htm), [Dawson
Engler](http://www.stanford.edu/~engler/), [Brian
Kernighan](http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/bwk/), and [Alan
Kay](http://www.viewpointsresearch.org/alan.html) were there to join in the
celebration...and those were just the ones I recognized! Very cool.

The panels and talks were videotaped, so you can [watch them on
SCPD](http://seminars.stanford.edu).
