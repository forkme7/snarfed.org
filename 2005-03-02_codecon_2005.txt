A couple weeks ago, I went to [CodeCon](http://codecon.org/), a conference that
draws hackers, programmers turned entrepreneurs, open source graybeards, and
people who just like to code. If you hack on software, it's an incredible
conference. It's small, but almost everyone is there because they love writing
code, and _everyone_ there is ridiculously smart. It also draws some
high-powered people from the open source community. Chances are you'll meet at
least a few people who wrote programs you use every day.

I've posted [notes on the projects](/CodeCon_2005_notes) for this year.
[Notes](/CodeCon_2004) and [pictures](/codecon_2004_pictures) from
last year are also available.
