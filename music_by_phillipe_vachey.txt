[Twinsen's
Adventure](http://www.twinadv.com/) and [Twinsen's
Odyssey](http://el-muerte.student.utwente.nl/lba/mirrors/official-to/index2.html)
are two of my favorite games of all time. They were developed by Adeline
Software and [Frédéric
Raynal](http://mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=65713/), who had
previously developed the landmark classic, [Alone in the
Dark](http://mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,2/gameId,325/).

The music for both Twinsen games was wonderful. It was universally praised by
reviewers, and fans filled message boards with messages saying that long after
they'd finished the games, they were still listening to the music.

[Phillipe Vachey](http://mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=627/)
composed the music for both games, and he's since worked on music for a number
of other games. Thanks to the [Magicball
Network](http://el-muerte.student.utwente.nl/lba/), you can download the entire
soundtracks to many games Phillipe has scored.

  * [Toy

Also, if you liked the music from the Twinsen games, you'll also enjoy the
[Beyond Good & Evil soundtrack](/beyond_good_and_evil_soundtrack).
