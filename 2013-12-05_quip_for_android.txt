We're live! For the last few months, I've been spending pretty much all my time
at work on our
[Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quip.quip). We
had a preview version of it available
[when we launched](/2013-07-30_introducing_quip), but it was very incomplete.
Most notably, you could read documents, but you couldn't edit them.

It took us some work to get all the subtleties of rich text editing working well
on Android, not to mention full offline support and our synching system, and
it's definitely still not perfect yet, but we're excited about it. It has full
feature parity with our
[iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quip/id647922896), and it will only
get better.

I've [spent my career](/resume) so far working on infrastructure, so building an
end user product was a very new challenge. It had its ups and downs, and the
Android platform gave us plenty of head scratchers - far beyond
[my initial Android experience](/2011-12-02_thoughts_on_writing_my_first_android_app)
a couple years ago - but overall, it's been a great experience. Wish us luck,
and if you have an Android phone or tablet, please
[try it out](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quip.quip) and
let us know what you think!
