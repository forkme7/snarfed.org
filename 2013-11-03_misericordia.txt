Misericordia

Word of the day: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Amisericordia">misericordia</a>, from <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68210.Gilead">Gilead</a></em>. <em>An indulgence as to food or dress granted to a member of a religious order.</em> Esoteric enough that it's not in my Kindle's dictionary.
