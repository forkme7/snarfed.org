Burger Doo Wop

We've been out to a couple fun places recently. Last Saturday, before the
[symphony](http://www.sfsymphony.org/templates/event_info.asp?nodeid=250&callid=93&eventid=1074),
Becca and I went to dinner at [Street](http://streetonpolk.com/). It's a
relaxed, [foodie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodie) friendly place in the
same mold as [Blue Plate](http://blueplatesf.com/) and [Front
Porch](http://thefrontporchsf.com/). Becca raved about their hamburger, [just
like Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hnoOXDcgN4xqLOU6lplGXg), and since she
never eats them, I knew it must be good.

Their kitchen hadn't quite opened when we walked in, so we hung out at the bar
for a while. Their cocktails were great, especially the homemade sangria and
margaritas. Later, when we sat down and looked at the menu, I figured we'd try
something new, but we couldn't resist the burger. It was _so_ worth it.

It's hard to pin down what exactly made it so good. It wasn't
[Kobe beef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_beef),
for example, or cooked in truffle oil or topped with caviar. It just all came
together perfectly. The bun was toasted just right, the gruyere and roasted
onions were ideal counterparts, and the meat melted in my mouth.

The second place worth noting is a great jazz club we went to last night. We'd
been to [Cafe Royale](http://www.caferoyale-sf.com/) a while back to hear
[Marcus Shelby](http://www.marcusshelby.com/), but they were taking a break
from live gigs, so we headed to [Savanna](http://savannajazz.com/) in the
Mission. We got there early, ordered drinks, and waited for the band to set
up.

It turned out to be Savanna's
[resident jazz trio](http://www.sfstation.com/the-vince-lateano-trio-e14163),
playing their regular Tuesday and Sunday night gig. They've gotten
[mixed reviews](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=savanna+near+94107&sll=37.444324,-122.149685&sspn=0.418135,0.201874&layer=&ie=UTF8&latlng=37750044,-122418239,9497819717881519846&ei=gGgBRri1OZzCiQPJl4HYBg&sig2=vr52kjgxBItG0tiMEStrgg&iwd=1&dtab=2&reviews=1&oi=more_rev&sa=X)
online, but we really liked them. They were great musicians, and they were
relaxed and enjoying themselves.

After their first break, they called a jam session and opened the stage. It
was clearly a regular thing, since sax players, singers, bassists, drummers,
and even a xylophonist turned up and took their turns jamming. They were all
remarkably good, and they were all clearly having fun. We loved it.

Next time you're bored on a Tuesday or Sunday, let us know! We'd love to go
again.
