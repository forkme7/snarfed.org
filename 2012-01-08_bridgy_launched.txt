I've just released [Bridgy](http://brid.gy/), a little side project I've been
working on. Got a blog? Share your blog posts on social networks? Wish comments
on those shared posts also showed up on your blog? Bridgy copies them back for
you.

Bridgy is a throwaway prototype on the road toward a larger project:
[OStatus for Facebook, Google+, and Twitter](/2011-07-27_facebook_app_for_ostatus).
I don't plan to update it much, provide end user support, or properly integrate
it with [WebFinger](http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/) or
[Salmon](http://salmon-protocol.org/) or the other
[OStatus](http://ostatus.org/about) component protocols. Still, it was a useful
way to explore the APIs, and it does actually work. Feel free to try it!
