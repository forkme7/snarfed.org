Ajax Comments in Pyblosxom

Since I [migrated this site](/2006-08-23_virtual_housewarming) to
[Pyblosxom](http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/), I've been tweaking it here and
there. My biggest tweak to date has been
[adding AJAX to comments](/pyblosxom_ajax_comments).

Specifically, comment previewing and posting can optionally use
[AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_\(programming\)), as opposed to full
HTTP POST requests. This avoids a full-size roundtrip and re-render, so
commenting feels faster and more lightweight.
