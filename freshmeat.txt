[Freshmeat](http://freshmeat.net/)
is a directory of open source projects, mostly for \*nix platforms. Unlike
[SourceForge](/SourceForge), Freshmeat doesn't host files or web space; it
just provides links, screenshots, and release history, organized in a _very_
comprehensive and searchable directory.

My projects [p4](/p4) and [bigbrother](/bigbrother) have
[Freshmeat](http://freshmeat.net/projects/bigbrother_im)
[entries](http://freshmeat.net/projects/p4), as do a few of my [other
projects](/software). Here's [my Freshmeat
profile](http://freshmeat.net/~blaize/).
