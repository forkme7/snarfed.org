Thoughts on having a baby

<ol>
<li>You expect your world to narrow a bit. You can't just bounce out the door
whenever you want any more, and you haven't figure out what the hell you're
doing yet.  
  
Even so, it's a surprise when your thoughts are suddenly consumed by _poop_, and
poop exclusively. Smell, color, texture, volume, frequency, how it
arrives, how it departs, what it symbolizes on a cosmic level.  
  
Friends told you this would happen, but still. It's silly. You realize you've
hit rock bottom when you start gushing at a dinner party about soft, even grains
in a thick yellow paste. Don't fight it; embrace it. (The talking, that is. Not
the poop.)</li>

<li>Asking other parents for advice is like reading the Bible. It's a deep well,
and there is some good stuff in there, but it's couched in language you don't
understand, and when you do piece together a few bits, they all contradict each
other.</li>

<li>The advice you do hear most often isn't really advice at all, so much as a
doomsday prophecy. "Your life will change forever," they intone vacantly. "What
should I do? How can I get ready?" They laugh, "There is no ready. Forsake all
hope, ye who enter parenthood! Pray you escape with your mortal soul!"  
  
This, of course, is maddening. It's the biggest change in your life, bar none -
getting married isn't even in the same league - and *you can't prepare for it.*
If you're used to bending the world to your will, you may bang your head against
this until you're bloody. I'd tell you not to, and you'd nod your head and
agree, and then you'd go bang some more.  
  
Repeat after me. _The baby will cry. The milk will spill. The poop will blowout.
It is all as it ever was, time and time again. Amen._</li>

<li>Sleep deprivation. This is the other advice you hear constantly...and again,
by advice I mean doomsday prophecy. You know how you greet new parents with a
gentle, "Getting any sleep?" It's not a joke. They're usually not getting _any_
sleep. They're up all night, feeding and rocking and pacifiering and white
noising and _not sleeping_. At all. Night after night.</li>

<li>Having said that, we're actually very lucky. Brooke was extremely chill for
her first month or so. She's awake and vocal more now, but still, she's pretty
damn easy relatively speaking. We have no idea which god smiled on us after all
the goats we sacrificed, but we'll take it.  
  
(I'm totally kidding,
[Baal](https://snarfed.org/2014-10-24_god-is-disappointed-in-you#baal). We know
it was you. The check's in the mail.)</li>

<li>In case it wasn't obvious, I have zero actual, honest-to-God insights here.
If you have a baby too, don't ask us for advice. We don't have any. _Definitely_
don't ask us about parenting, we're nowhere near doing any of that. Brooke isn't
really a person yet anyway; more like an eating, sleeping, pooping automaton.
Ask us again in 18 years. Maybe.</li>

<li>The cats have been great. They took a few days to warm up to Brooke, but now
they love her, and they're very gentle. In general, if you worry about pets
attacking your baby or smothering them, don't. They're more likely to get
kidnapped out of their crib by the
[chupacabra](https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Achupacabra). Instead,
worry about *actual* dangers: falling into the pool, getting hit by a car, or
developing allergies and
[metabolic syndrome](https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Ametabolic+syndrome)
(among others) due to oversanitizing.</li>

<li>You won't have the time or attention span to worry about any of that anyway,
though. One of the biggest things you lose is _unbroken time_. Love going for a
long run, playing a great [game](/games) until 2am, or curling up and
reading a trashy book cover to cover? Too bad. Free time now comes in 5-15
minute bursts. Get used to running upstairs with a laundry basket,
playing Candy Crush on your phone, and reading Facebook posts instead.  \
<br /> \
[Podcasts](/podcasts) and audiobooks are great for this. They keep you
entertained but leave your hands free. Add a bluetooth headset or headphones and
you're golden.</li>

<li>The worse part, especially for high functioning, high powered people, is the
nagging sense of helplessness. If you're accustomed to controlling your
environment, being productive, _getting things done_, well hoo boy get ready. A
baby will smack you upside your head right quick. The first time they scream for
an hour straight and you can't calm them down, no matter how much you feed or
rock or play white noise or shove that pacifier down their throat, it's tough.
The tenth time? The hundredth? It gets very demoralizing, very fast.  
  
Take a step back, leave them and close the door for a minute to catch your
breath, then count your blessings. She may be pissed, but she's also healthy,
vibrant, and _damn_ but she has a pair of lungs on her. She could be the next
Lady Gaga. More importantly, she'll be fine, I promise. Zen out and roll with
it.</li>

<li>If you came here looking for concrete tips, I hope you stopped reading a
while back. That's clearly not my bag. I will happily shill for one product,
though:
[Dr. Brown's](http://www.drbrownsbaby.com/healthy-wipes/pacifier-bottle-wipes)
bottles and pacifiers. They're great.  
  
I don't know what it is about babies and burping and farting, but they have a
love/hate relationship. You'll think about them a *lot*, second only to poop.
There are tons of techniques and positions to avoid swallowing air, but in the
end, Dr. Brown's bottles were the biggest winner for us. Brooke stopped fighting
and actually relaxed while she ate.
