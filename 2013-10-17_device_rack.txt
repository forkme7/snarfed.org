Device rack

Mobile and tablet are just as important to us as web at
[Quip](https://quip.com/), so naturally we have lots of different physical
phones and tablets to test on. All those chargers can get pretty tangled just
lying around, though, so we wanted a good way to store devices, charge them, and
find them easily later.

Fortunately, [Ken Fulk](http://kenfulk.com/) agreed to continue their awesome
work on our [vintage mechanical decor](/2013-06-04_new-office-decor) and
designed and built a custom device rack. It holds all of phones, tablets, and
chargers with room to spare, but still feels very fun and old world. Check it
out!
