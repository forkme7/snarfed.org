Device rack

Mobile and tablet are critical to us at [Quip](https://quip.com/), so naturally
we have lots of different physical devices to test on. All those chargers can
get pretty tangled just lying around, though, so we wanted a better way to store
our test devices, charge them, and find them easily later.

Fortunately, [Ken Fulk](http://kenfulk.com/) agreed to continue their awesome
work on our [vintage mechanical decor](/2013-06-04_new-office-decor) and
designed and built a custom device rack. It holds all of our phones, tablets,
and chargers with room to spare, but still feels very fun and old world. Thanks
guys!
