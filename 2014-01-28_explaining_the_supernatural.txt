[Daniel Dennett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett) provides the best
explanation for the supernatural I've heard yet:

> ...the urge is very strong to interpret things that move in irregular
> ways...as agents. A favorite demonstration of this in introductory psychology
> is [a brief animation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZBKer6PMtM)...\[that]
> shows two triangles and a circle moving around, in and out of a box. The
> geometric shapes couldn't look less like people (or animals), but it is almost
> irresisible to see their interactions as purposeful, driven by lust, fear,
> courage, and anger...

> We are born with an
> ["agent detection device,"](http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences//retrieve/pii/S1364661399014199?cc=y)
> and it is often on a hair trigger. When it misfires, as it often does in
> stressful circumstances,
> [we tend to see](http://books.google.com/books/about/Breaking_the_Spell.html?id=e2eVSvJieC0C)
> ghost, goblins, imps, leprechauns, fairies, gnomes, demons, and the like where
> all that is really there are waving branches, toppling stone walls, or
> creaking doors.
