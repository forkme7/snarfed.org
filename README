This package holds a collection of macros for the web/wiki server SnipSnap.
The official snarfed.jar web site has more information. It is located at

  http://snarfed.org/space/snipsnap+macros

The SnipSnap web site is located at:

  http://snipsnap.org/


To install and use these macros, place the jar file in your SnipSnap
application's WEB-INF/lib/ subdirectory and restart SnipSnap.

For example, if SnipSnap is installed in /usr/share/snipsnap-0.4.2a, and your
application is called foo, place this jar file in the directory:

  /usr/share/snipsnap-0.4.2a/applications/foo/WEB-INF/lib/


If you've downloaded the source, you'll need to edit the Makefile and specify
where your SnipSnap installation is located.
