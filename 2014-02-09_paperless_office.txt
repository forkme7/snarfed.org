The paperless office arrived, and no one noticed

We used to hear a lot about the paperless office. Remember that? Back then we
printed reports, filled out forms by hand, sent memos and shopped from catalogs
and cursed junk mail. We used paper for pictures and greeting cards and other
things we loved, too, but it was still a hassle sometimes. When the early days
of the internet showed us a glimpse of a better way, we jumped at the idea.

That idea's time has come. We now do business over email
([or better](http://quip.com/)), buy things online, download tickets to our
phones, share pictures on screens and store them in the cloud. Computers may
have spawned even more paper during their
["terrible twos,"](http://www.parenting.com/article/terrible-twos-myth) but
that's pretty clearly over. We can debate whether trading less paper for more
energy is a net win for the environment, but it's largely academic. We do need
more sustainable energy, but we're
[not going to give up technology](/2013-04-13_the-no-network-effect) and fire up
the pulp mills again. That paper boat has sailed.

The part that interests me is the public awareness. For a while, tons of ink was
spilled (onto paper!) heralding the arrival of the paperless office. Society
didn't quite cooperate, though, and the press gradually turned to other topics,
looking back with scorn in year end top ten lists and "where are they now"
pieces until the very phrase "paperless office" became a joke.

It wasn't a joke, though. It arrived - we're living in it! - but it didn't
arrive on the pundits' schedule. It was a gradual societal shift, which is
basically kryptonite for the press. Journalists understand events. They can dig
up stories and report them. Slow, long term changes? Those are left to
historians and intellectuals in musty, forgotten libraries. (Science reporting
has the same problem, with an extra poison pill: individual papers and
discoveries _seem_ like meaningful scientific events, but often aren't.)

This pattern isn't unique to the paperless office, of course. Predicting the
future is fraught in general, but predicting slow societial shifts is especially
thankless. Even if you agree on the criteria, it usually takes
[a generation or more](/2013-06-27_are-generational-shifts-slowing-down) to see
if you were right. Not many people have attention spans that long. I know I
don't.

Fortunately, people smarter than me are thinking about this too.
[The Long Now Foundation](http://longnow.org/) is one of my favorites. They
encourage people to think on the scale of millenia, and they put their money
where their mouth is with projects like [Long Bets](http://longbets.org/) and
the [10,000 Year Clock](http://longnow.org/clock/). They're doing great work.

As for the paperless office, I'm writing this on a computer, you're reading it
on one, and if you know me, the last time we interacted was probably on a
computer too. Like most societal shifts, it doesn't matter too much if anyone
noticed that the paperless office arrived, or how long it took. The important
part is that it's here.
