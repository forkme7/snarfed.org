I'm in the market for a new side project. I'm looking for something related to
climate change. I don't know if I'll end up
[farming biochar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar),
[spraying aerosols into the sky](http://mcbproject.org/),
[hacking solar panel trackers](http://www.sunfolding.com/), or something else
entirely, but those are the kinds of thing I'm thinking about.

I'm leaning toward something technical. I'm open to coding, but ideally that
won't be my primary contribution.
[I've had a blast hacking on open source projects](/software), and I'm sure I'll
do more, but right now I'm thinking about something different.

So far, I've just been [reading](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/)
[a lot](http://books.google.com/books?id=eAWiPwAACAAJ) and learning as much as I
can. There's lots of great stuff going on, and I've found
[a few](http://www.poc21.cc/) [open](https://oscedays.org/)
[communities](http://climatecolab.org/) here and there, but most substantial
projects are either companies or academic research labs. Those are both great,
but they're hard to join part time and contribute a handful of hours a week.

The next step is to talk to people who know more, or know other people who do.
If you know the space and have an interesting problem I might be able to help
with, or if you know someone who might, [please drop me a line](/about)!
