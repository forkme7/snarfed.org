I was an intern at [EA](http://www.ea.com/) in 1999 and
[LucasArts](http://lucasarts.com/) in 2002. I worked on three games, and
[MobyGames lists me in the credits for two of them](http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,64418/),
as a tester on
[SuperCross 2000](http://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/supercross-2000/credits) (N64)
at EA and as a programmer on
[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter](http://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/star-wars-bounty-hunter/credits)
(PS2) at LucasArts. I also worked as a tester on
[Hot Wheels: Turbo Racing](http://www.mobygames.com/game/n64/hot-wheels-turbo-racing/credits)
(N64) at EA.
