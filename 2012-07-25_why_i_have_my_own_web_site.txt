Why I have my own web site

[Brett](http://www.onebigfluke.com/) recently laid out his reasons for
[keeping his own web site](http://www.onebigfluke.com/2012/07/focusing-on-positives-why-i-have-my-own.html#comment-form)
in the age of powerful, easy-to-use alternatives like
[Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/), [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/), and
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/). He does it to have a home, express himself, and
be a citizen of the Internet. He not-so-subtly inspired me to describe my
reasons too, in my own words, so here goes.

The main reason I have my own web site and domain is _control_.

First, as Brett
[describes](http://www.onebigfluke.com/2012/07/focusing-on-positives-why-i-have-my-own.html),
they're a _home_ that I control, so I can keep them in the same place, no matter
what else changes. If my web site ever moves, or my email address changes, some
people I've drifted away from but still care about may never find the new one.
Owning a domain lets me keep them the same for as long as I want, hopefully
forever, so I never have to lose those people. "Leased" homes like Facebook or
GMail may last a long time, but even they may eventually move, or die.

Second, my own web site lets me control _my stuff_. Brett calls this "have
keepsakes in the future" and "don't lose your data." In the past, my stuff was
physical. Now, my pictures, writing, code, documents, address book, music, love
letters, and all sorts of other stuff live on computers like this web site. It's
actually a better place than my laptop, or Facebook. It won't get stolen, I won't
spill coffee on it, and because I control it, it won't change my privacy
settings and
[expose drunken pictures to my boss](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/12/check_your_facebook_privacy_se.html),
or
[get acquired, pivot, and dump my blog posts overboard](http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/26/social-network-pioneer-friendster-to-erase-all-user-photos-blogs-and-more-on-may-31/).

I also want to express myself and be an Internet citizen. I think of my posts
here as a diary, a scrapbook I can easily share with others and reminisce over
in the future. I also enjoy writing, and the discipline of doing it in public
makes me take it more seriously. Finally, I love the information utility of the
Internet, and I try to do my part and give back, even if the result is often
[mind-numbingly boring](http://snarfed.org/sole-elliptical-need-lube-message).

However,
[as quadhome describes](http://www.onebigfluke.com/2012/07/focusing-on-positives-why-i-have-my-own.html?showComment=1343125796424#c7358231521011566545),
none of those things really require _my own_ web site. Tumblr or Facebook would
be fine.

I empathize with the yoke-chafing that the
[Indie Web](http://indiewebcamp.com/Why) people feel, but not the
[heavy-handed comparisons to slave labor](http://nomoresharecropping.org/2010/12/no-more-sharecropping/).
I just can't get myself worked up about someone monetizing a tweet about what I
ate for breakfast. If you make a living by creating content online, in public,
great! You're in the minority, though, and I'm not sure the Indie Web is really
about you. For the rest of us, populism and anti-capitalism are always safe
bets, so the shrill chorus of "Facebook is evil! Don't let them use you!" may
work, but personally, it's not my bag.

So. Why do I own my own web site and domain? Not monetizing my content. Not
politics, web or otherwise. I do want to express myself and be a citizen of the
Internet, but those aren't enough on their own. My reason is _control_, control
over where people find me and where I keep my stuff.

How about you?
