Opaque and Real Escape Game

We tried a couple unusual things this weekend that turned out to be a lot of
fun. The first was [Opaque](http://sf.darkdining.com/), a restaurant where you
eat entirely in the dark. The servers are blind, so they're well equipped to
guide you to your table and orient you to plates and silverware you can't see.
You can order from a menu, or you can go the "mystery" route and try to identify
whatever the chef decides to serve you.

The idea is, of course, that losing your sight will heighten your other senses.
It's a gimmick, but it's an interesting one, and it mostly delivered. The food
was good, if not great, but the total absence of light definitely made us pay
more attention to everything, including each other. We may not make it a habit,
but it was a great experience.

Next came
[Real Escape Game: Escape from the Haunted Ship](http://realescapegame.com/escape-from-the-haunted-ship/).
It's part scavenger hunt, part team puzzle solving, and part interactive theatre
a la [Sleep No More](http://sleepnomorenyc.com/). We filed into the cargo hold
of the storied [S.S. Jeremiah](http://www.ssjeremiahobrien.org/), formed teams,
and then the lights died and the ghost story started. We scrambled to find
clues, solve puzzles, and decipher riddles hidden in videos and performances and
other unlikely places so we could finish the story.

It was a lot of fun. The word teasers and number puzzles and logic games were a
bit predictable, but the props and acting and hints in unexpected places took it
up a notch, and they played the "haunted ship" ambience to the hilt. They do
other games too.
[Escape from the Mysterious Room](http://realescapegame.com/rersf1/) comes
[highly recommended](https://plus.google.com/115863474911002159675/posts/VpCHmTohDBj),
but tickets are almost gone. Hopefully they'll run more in the future!
