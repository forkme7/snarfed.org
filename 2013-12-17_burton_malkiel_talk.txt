Took [my dad](http://one-one.net/team.htm) to meet
[Burton Malkiel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burton_Malkiel) last night, of
_[Random Walk Down Wall Street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street)_
fame, and hear him talk about investing in the modern economic climate. Lots of
fun!
[Fed watching](http://marketrealist.com/2013/11/fed-matter-policies-moving-market/),
[fund unbundling](https://www.wealthfront.com/tax-optimized-index-portfolio),
and [tax loss harvesting](https://www.wealthfront.com/tax-loss-harvesting) are
totally sexy.

Thanks to [Maya](https://twitter.com/papayamaya) and
[Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/) for organizing!
