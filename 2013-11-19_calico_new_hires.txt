It's about time we heard some news out of
[Calico](http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2013/09/calico-announcement.html), the
new aging research biotech company Art Levinson and Larry Page started a couple
months ago. They
[announced four new hires today](https://plus.google.com/108880830087528406119/posts/22aWigXdYab),
all top researchers in different medical and biological fields.

I'm excited to finally get more details, but I have to admit, I'm also selfishly
disappointed that none of the principals are engineers. Calico's charter
promised biotech just as much as medical research, so I wish there was more
concrete news on that front. We haven't heard about engineer colleagues even
talking to Calico, much less joining, so I have to wonder. Hope it's in the
works!
