Just as a heads up, I'm headed out on vacation for the next week. If you get
in touch with me for anything, I probably won't get back to you until Monday
3/23 or so.

For those who are interested, we're spending part of the week in
[Napa](http://www.laresidence.com/), for
[food](http://cyrusrestaurant.com/)
[and](http://www.aubergedusoleil.com/)
[wine](http://quintessa.com/)
[tasting](http://cakebread.com/),
and the rest in
[Inverness](http://www.mankas.com/), for
[hiking](http://www.tomalesbay.net/),
[kayaking](http://www.bwkayak.com/), and maybe
[horseback riding](http://www.fivebrooks.com/pages/services.htm).
See you on the other side!
