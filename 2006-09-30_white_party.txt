Last weekend,
[Orkut](/gallery/white_party/orkut_cheers.jpg),
[Clayton](/gallery/white_party/clayton_cynthia_cool.jpg), and
[Derek](/gallery/white_party/derek_orkut.jpg)
said goodbye to their Soma loft in style.
[White Party](white_party) was some of the most fun I've had in a
while.

Everyone really got into the theme. Along with the

there were
[gorgeous decorations](/gallery/white_party/boa_chair.jpg),
an

a
[photo booth](/gallery/white_party/photo_booth.jpg),
and of course, the world famous Studio 767
[go-go dancers](/gallery/white_party/go_go_dancer_2.jpg).

I especially enjoyed putting together
