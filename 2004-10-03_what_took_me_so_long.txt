What took me so long?

I can't imagine why, but I have something of a
[foil-hat](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TinFoilHat) reputation among my friends. They
point to my lack of a cell phone
([for](/cell_phone_npr_story.html)
[various](http://www.economist.com/node/2300557)
[reasons](http://launch.yahoo.com/song/default.asp?songID=3439909)), my avoidance
of credit cards, my tendency to give fake addresses and phone numbers at
[Fry's](http://frys.com/), and my incessant rants about [Social Security
numbers](http://www.cpsr.org/cpsr/privacy/ssn/ssn.structure.html).

Given all that, I don't know why it took me so long, but I finally generated a
[PGP](http://www.pgp.net/pgp-faq/) keypair for myself. Whee! I also uploaded it
to [MIT's keyserver](http://pgp.mit.edu/) and posted a link on my [contact
page](/about). Not that I expect you to use it to
email me your bank account number, or your mother's maiden name...but if you
really want to, now you can!
