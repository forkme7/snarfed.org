I just finished posting
[pictures](/le_diner_2011) from San Francisco's first "pop-up" white dinner,
[Le Dîner à San Francisco](http://www.ledinerasanfrancisco.info/),
modeled after the classic Parisian
[Le Dîner en Blanc](http://paris.untappedcities.com/2011/06/17/in-pictures-the-2011-paris-diner-en-blanc/).

It was a lot of fun. They announced the location just a couple hours beforehand -
Golden Gate Park's Music Concourse - and hundreds of us all showed up with good
food, white tablecloths, white chairs, white decorations, and most importantly,
our best (all) white clothes.

We all had a great time. Strolling past fountains with a glass of champagne,
listening to street musicians play Debussy and Ravel, watching the
[amazing sunset](/le_diner_2011#shutter_22), making new friends and catching up
with old ones...not so shabby.

We'll definitely be back next year. You should come with us!
