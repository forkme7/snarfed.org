switch control and caps lock

<p class="right"><img src="/sunkeys.jpg" /></p>

[Sun keyboards](http://www.sunstuff.org/hardware/components/keyboards/) have a
few differences from normal 101-key keyboards. One is that the locations of the
left Control and Caps Lock keys are switched. If you use the Control key often,
this makes a big difference, ergonomically. Here's how to switch the left
Control and Caps Lock keys on normal keyboards, on any \*nix platform that runs
X Windows.

Add these two lines to `~/.Xmodmap`:

    ! Switch caps lock and (left) control
    remove Lock = Caps_Lock
    remove Control = Control_L
    keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
    keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
    add Lock = Caps_Lock
    add Control = Control_L

Now load the changes into X:

    $ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap

Voila! You're now one step closer to Sun keyboard bliss.
