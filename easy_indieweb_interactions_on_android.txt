Commenting, liking, and retweeting have never been quite as easy on the
[IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) as on Facebook, Twitter, and other
[silos](http://indiewebcamp.com/silos), _especially_ on mobile. There are
[bookmarklets for WordPress](/indieweb_press_this_bookmarklets_for_wordpress)
[and Known](http://werd.io/2014/my-indieweb-life-how-my-site-gives-me-an-awesome##reply+to+my+friends)
that work well on desktop, but they're not easy to set up on phones or tablets,
and they don't work at all outside the browser. If you're reading a post in your
feed reader app, and you want to [indie like](http://indiewebcamp.com/like) it,
you're out of luck...

...until now! The
[Bookmarklet Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kurtchen.android.bookmarklet.free)
app lets you share to a custom URL - like your site's posting interface! - and
pass the title and link as parameters. This means you can reply to or like a
post from any Android app _with just three taps_: Share, then the Bookmarklet
Free custom URL, then your site's publish button. What's more, if your site can
[POSSE](http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE) silo
[interactions](http://indiewebcamp.com/interactions), or you use
[Bridgy Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publish), it even works from the
Twitter and Facebook apps. Living the dream!

For example, if you use the
[IndieWeb Press This bookmarklets](/indieweb_press_this_bookmarklets_for_wordpress),
here's how to set up a share bookmarklet for likes. Open the _Bookmarklet_ app,
tap _Custom Services_, then the menu icon in the bottom right, then _Create
Custom Services_, then fill in the fields like as shown here, replacing
`https://snarfed.org/w/` with your site's WordPress path. (Also make sure you
have the most recent version of the
[IndieWeb Press This plugin](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-indieweb-press-this)
[as of Oct. 21 2014](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-indieweb-press-this/commit/962a11c4168206a422c3b2532f9c3c6265669f75).)

For other types of interactions, just change `type=like` in the Base URL to
`type=reply`, `type=repost`, or `type=rsvp`, respectively.

If you're on [Known](http://withknown.com/), try using
`http://YOURSITE/share?share_type=reply` as the Base URL, `share_url` as the URL
parameter name, and leave the Title parameter name blank.

Happy interacting!
