hey jin! thanks for accepting. out of curiosity, are you working on AncestryDNA? i've been looking into computational biology research work recently, and a friend at 23&Me suggested i talk to you all.

any chance i can buy you a coffee or beer sometime? i'm in SF and flexible on when/where. thanks in advance!

my background: https://snarfed.org/resume
'''
i've been talking to people about computational biology research (ie not
directly product side) recently - at startups, big pharma, and
university/foundation research labs - and i'd love to talk to someone at counsyl
too!

i'm mostly just interested in an informational meeting at this point,
but as an example, this is the kind of thing i might be interested in:

thanks in advance!

Computational biology research?

Hi! I really admire the work you all are doing on polymerase based sequencing. There's tons of potential in the high quality, long read, low error machines you offer.

I've been doing software engineering for a while (details: https://snarfed.org/resume ), and recently I've been looking at computational biology research. I'd love to hear more about your work on the research side, and maybe see if there's a fit for me.

Any chance you could connect me with someone there for a 15 min informational phone call or coffee? Thanks in advance!
'''

main dna sequencing techniques:
- optical. illumina etc. chop up, shine light through, measure.
- electrical. genapsys etc
- nanopore (electronic). oxford nanopore etc. read length ~5kbp. systematic errors.
- SMRT (single molecule, real-time). pacbio etc. uses nano-scale DNA polymerase.
  high quality, long read (~5k), low error.

related technique: PCR, polymerase chain reaction, for amplifying small DNA samples.

cover letter:
Hi! I've been doing software engineering for the last 12 years. Recently, I've been learning a lot about bioinformatics and computational biology - genomics, sure, but also epigenetics, proteomics, microbiome, cheminformatics, etc. There are lots of other places with attractive offers, but not many with Illumina's position and impact. I'd love to talk about opportunities!

Short summary of my experience: 10 years building infrastructure and distributed systems at Google. Co-founded App Engine, Google's first and most profitable cloud computing platform, and led its storage team for 5 years. Key numbers: >$100M yearly run rate, platform serves ~400kqps, storage system serves >1Mqps and stores >1000PB and >1T rows. For the last 18 mos, I've been a principal at an enterprise startup, Quip.

hey guys! how have you been? congrats on founding color, and othman, on the new baby! gina and i are expecting our own in a month too. we're excited, and a little terrified. :P

i've been considering a career move recently, and i'm talking to a lot of people about biotech and informatics research. taylor and i had a great talk a few years ago, last time i poked around, and color looks like it has huge potential. i'd love to hear what you both think about the space. interested?

i'm often free for drinks after work, if any weekdays coming up work for you. hope to see you soon!


hey kieron, how have you been? long time no see! hope the peninsula and anacor are treating you well.

i've been doing a traditional software startup for the last couple years, but i've started looking into biotech and informatics research again. i really appreciated chatting with you a few years ago, and the people you introduced me to! i'm curious what you think of the space now. any big new developments, players, or ideas?

i don't know if you make it up to SF much, but i'd love to grab coffee or drinks if you do. otherwise, i can definitely ping you next time i'm down south. hope you're good otherwise!

CONCLUSIONS FROM PEOPLE
===
dan chao:
get a phd! also connectome project, mesoblast

taylor sittler:
co-founder color genomics w/othman
formerly residency at UCSF, worked w/Berkeley's Amp Lab
said they're hiring

bex graciano:
medical imaging! (she's a radiologist)

kieron wesson:
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/14852bc94421aa96
gamification
semantic analysis
canonical data mining
human epigenetic project, Julie granka
protein protein interactions
gene regulations
EU brain project

layton wedgeworth:
was at invitae for 18mos, now at instacart. likes the company a lot, but he was
on the product side, hard to move from there to research.

jenan wise:
2nd employee at counsyl, was there 6y. straight sw eng, not bio person
counsyl is focused on clinical product, medical application, not basic research
doing skunk works moon hlot group in sf, but more on big new steps in clinical
23me has ignored fda and doctors. trying to do basic research on dataset,
finding genome phenome mappings, mixed success

harry vlahos:
at device company, separates liquids into very small samples for big assays
was at roche in pa, others
wants to do startup to sequence individual cells in times etc, since they mutate
and skew and become heterogeneous fast, and sequencing often just returns the
"average" of the different genomes
recommends genapsys, genia, oxford nano pore
genapsys does real time, cheap (dollars) short read (thousands of base pairs)
sequencing to look for specific mutations

pat riley:
runs Google Accelerated Science team w/mike frumkin
MTV, in research org, under alfred spector
8+ people, collaborates on research projects with univs, biotech cos, etc
goal is usually to publish. projects are 9-12+ mos. has given a few $300kish
  grants but not the focus. lots of prospecting for new projects.
current projects:
- neuron microscopy imaging, understand nerve growth patterns
- screen for drug docking using a model. structural vs ligand docking.
- machine learning for ligand drug screening

diane tang:
runs 10-person health/life sciences infrastructure team in Google X
other health/life sciences teams in X are 1) pure wet lab research, 2) devices
lots of partners: big pharma, academic research, gov't, etc
they're doing primarily infrastructue: big data from samples, sequencing, etc
  coming from baseline study, partners, etc. need to be able to store it safely
  and compliantly, then do compute over it.
right now focused on building infra platform; eventually will turn to doing more
  actual research over data.
10 person org, mostly old timers (youngest goog tenur is 6y ish). wants eng's
  who know goog infrastructure!

chris jones:
kieron's brother in law, cancer molecular bio researcher
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/148603775c4eb0f9
pointed to other research groups
notable: Carlo Maley at UCSF

greg koskowich:
president of otokinetics, hearing aid device startup
recommended Andrew Hessel
look at CDC, FDA, NIH, see what solicitations etc they currently have out
go to upcoming VC conference on biotech, meet them, see portfolio companies
has contact at Kaiser Venture arm, could intro
Thomas Fogarty institute

reece hart:
introed by layton wedgeworth
background in bio, but also programmed. PhD in molecular bio, MS in CS.
worked on human genome project, then genentech for ~9y, then berkeley (QB3
  interdisciplinary/biz dev licensing) invitae (employee #1), now 23&me.
funding was tough at berkeley. liked genentech, loved invitae, likes 23&me so far.

alex furman:
one of the founders at invitae

brandon allgood:
CTO of numerate, startup that uses machine learning to find drug candidate
molecules. (pat linehan used to work there)
12 people. recently closed 4M funding, switched biz models to finding candidate
molecules *first* and then selling them to pharma cos.
not hiring right now but we'll keep in touch.

mike fero and rob mcintyre, teselagen:
seed stage, funded by angels (including mike) and NSF SBIR grants
productizes j5, research from another founder at berkeley/JBEI for constructing
full length DNA strands and generating lab protocols to clone them
right now just software, hoping to partner with e.g. clonetech to fill in rest
of design/build/test/evolve (aka iterate) loop
very interested!

zac apte, ubiome:
consumer microbiome startup, basically 23&me for your microbiome
8ish people, in SOMA
mostly scientists, some who code. frontend product is outsourced to pakistanis
managed by amazon.com ppl.
focusing on research, trying to find correlations to phenome reported by users.
in house automated wet lab, has lots of capacity ready.

jon sorenson, invitae, 12/15-ish:
four core sw groups: scientist tools, bioinf pipeline, lab (LIMS/robotics)
lots of future opportunities:
https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/invitae/14a557794e4e215b

krishna pant, invitae, runs bioinformatics team, 12/30/2014 in PA:
org structure is very loose, historically flat and no titles, only recently
added structure
wants infrastructure and sw eng culture from me, willing to train me in bio.
wanted to see what i wanted to work on
warned that there was grungy boring stuff too
sees work as a mix of long term research/clinical bets mixed with day to day
development/ops on core product and service
