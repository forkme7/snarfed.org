2010 Year-end recaps

<p class="right"><img src="/champagne_glasses.jpg" /></p>

I'm not in the habit of writing year end posts, but I still enjoy reading them.
[Like last year](/2010-01-05_year_end_recaps), I've collected a few of the 2010
end-of-year articles that I particularly enjoyed. Read them in health, and happy
new year!


_People:_

  * [Clayton Jones](http://cl8on.blog.com/2010/12/31/2010-good-bye-to-jonesy-the-king-of-soma/),
who moved to Shanghai in July and hasn't looked back. He has amazing stories!

  * [Christopher Baus](http://baus.net/new-years-review), who included
    reflections, resolutions, and my favorite, predictions.


_Tech:_

  * [App Engine 1.4.0](http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2010/12/happy-holidays-from-app-engine-team-140.html).
  It's a hell of a release, even if
  [I am biased](/2008-04-07_google_app_engine_launched).

  * [SnipSnap is back](http://snipsnap.org/space/start/2011-01-03/1)! I may be
  [on Wordpress now](http://snarfed.org/2010-08-08_migrated_to_wordpress), but
  SnipSnap will always have a [special place](http://snarfed.org/snipsnap) in my
  heart and [Maulik](http://maulik.net/)'s.


_Games:_


  * [December and 2010 NPDs](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6258/npd_behind_the_numbers_december_.php).
    [NPD](http://npd.com/corpServlet?nextpage=entertainment-categories_s.html)
    may have had a few hiccoughs in 2010, and their lack of (real) digital
    download numbers continues to be a gaping hole, but they're still the only
    game in town.

  * [Gamasutra's Best of 2010](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6246/gamasutras_best_of_2010.php).
  It's not short - you'll hear the thud as this one hits your browser - but it's
  worth reading.

  * [Joystiq's Best of 2010](http://www.joystiq.com/tag/joystiq-best-of-2010).
    More interesting than the rest due to their
    [unconventional selection process](http://www.joystiq.com/2010/12/31/joystiq-podcast-163-game-of-the-year-2010-edition/).

  * [Best games of the year](http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/106969) and,
    even better,
    [predictions revisited](http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/107041) from
    [Gamers with Jobs](http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/). I love those guys.
