Last night, I went to see [Britney Spears](http://britney.com/) in
[concert](http://www.britneyspears.com/tour.php).

Yes, you read that right. A friend of mine heard about the concert on Monday
afternoon, sent an email that night, rounded up a few people, and by Tuesday
evening we were standing in line outside the Oakland Coliseum, scalped tickets
in hand.

of the show itself from reputable news sites, so I'll keep this short. The show
had huge production values, lots of props and lights and pyrotechnics and big
video screens. The circus-clown emcee was obnoxious, and the "Onyx Hotel" theme
was just plain weird. And yes, there were lots and lots of girls in their 20s
in short skirts and heavy makeup, and yes, a couple of the songs were
intentionally sexual.

The show was planned. Almost every song had an involved dance sequence, and
Britney et al. supposedly spent two months just learning the choreography.
Between her costumes and and her scripted "candid" words to the crowd between
songs, Britney came off as almost a caricature of herself.

However, there were times in the show when she let down her guard and forgot
about the script, and we could see that she's just a girl who likes to dance
and sing. She was having fun, and it was infectious. I was smiling when I
left.
