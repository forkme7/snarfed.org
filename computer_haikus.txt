I've long since lost the primary source for these, but
they're now [scattered all over the
internet](http://www.google.com/search?q=computer+haikus). Think of them as
internet folklore.

**Haikus. Computers.**  
**They don't seem related. Or**  
**do they? You decide.**  

> Chaos reigns within.
> Reflect, repent, and reboot.
> Order shall return.

Three things are certain:  
Death, taxes, and lost data.  
Guess which has occurred.

> A file that big?
> It might be very useful.
> But now it is gone.

Yesterday it worked  
Today it is not working  
Windows is like that

> The Tao that is seen
> Is not the true Tao, until
> You bring fresh toner.

Windows NT crashed.  
I am the Blue Screen of Death.  
No one hears your screams.

> A crash reduces
> your expensive computer
> to a simple stone.

You step in the stream,  
but the water has moved on.  
This page is not here.

> Out of memory.
> We wish to hold the whole sky,
> But we never will.

Having been erased,  
The document you're seeking  
Must now be retyped.

> Rather than a beep
> Or a rude error message,
> These words: "File not found."

Serious error.  
All shortcuts have disappeared.  
Screen. Mind. Both are blank.

> The Web site you seek
> cannot be located but
> endless others exist

ABORTED effort:  
Close all that you have.  
You ask way too much.

> First snow, then silence.
> This thousand dollar screen dies
> so beautifully.

With searching comes loss  
and the presence of absence:  
"My Novel" not found.

> Stay the patient course
> Of little worth is your ire
> The network is down

Error messages  
cannot completely convey.  
We now know shared loss.
