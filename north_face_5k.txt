North Face 5K

[Jeremy](http://www.facebook.com/cotter) and I ran in the [North Face Endurance Challenge](http://www2.thenorthface.com/endurancechallenge/) 5K this year at [Fort Baker](http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/park-sites/fort-baker.html), just west of Sausalito and the Golden Gate Bridge. The route was mostly trail, with some mild elevation. I ran it in 22 minutes, roughly 7:00 mile pace. The event also hosted 10k, half and full marathon, 50k, and 50 mile events. Next time I'll have to do at least the 10k!
