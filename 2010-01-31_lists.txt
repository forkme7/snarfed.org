I like to [keep track](/lists) of some the things I do. Naturally, there are [pictures](/pictures) and [past posts](/index) from this site, but there are plenty of other lists too.

For food and drink, there's [chocolate](/chocolate), [friday mexican dinner](/friday_mexican_dinner), [beer](/beer), and [wine](/wine). For media, there's [books](/books), [games](/games), [feeds](/feeds), [podcasts](/podcasts), [movies](/movies), and [tv](/tv). And for things I create instead of consume, there's [talks](/talks), [software](/software), and [writing](/writing).

Check out [lists](/lists) for the full, uh...list!
