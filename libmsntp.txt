[libmsntp](https://github.com/snarfed/libmsntp) is a full-featured, compact,
portable SNTP library. You can
[get it on github](https://github.com/snarfed/libmsntp).

[SNTP](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2030.html) is a simplified version of
[NTP](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1305.html), which allows precise
synchronization of system clocks over a best-effort network. libmsntp provides
SNTP client and server functionality in a shared library with a simple API.

libmsntp is implemented as a thin layer on top of
[msntp](http://packages.debian.org/sid/msntp), N.M. Maclaren's command-line SNTP
utility. msntp is compact, straightforward, and elegant, and I'm indebted to
Nick and Cambridge's High Performance Computing Facility for providing the msntp
source to the public.

libmsntp is supported on most flavors of \*nix. See the Makefile and
README.msntp in the tarball for more information.

libmsntp is distributed under the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html),
and has been included in a number of Linux distributions. Copyright 2005
