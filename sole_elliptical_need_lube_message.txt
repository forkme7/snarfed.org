Got a [Sole elliptical machine](http://www.soletreadmills.com/Ellipticals/)? Is
it displaying a `NEED LUBE` error message when you turn it on? Tyler at Sole
service told me this is a software bug. It appears every 180 miles of usage, and
it was really only intended for treadmills, not ellipticals.

You can clean and lubricate the rails and wheels - and you should - but the
error message won't go away. Instead, you can get rid of it by resetting the
odometer. First, press and hold the Start, Enter, and Stop buttons for five
seconds to enter engineering mode. Use the arrow keys to select `FUNCTIONS`,
then select `ODO RESET` and press Enter. Turn the machine off and on again, and
voila, no error message.

Thanks Tyler! Happy exercising!
