Need to use an [OAuth](http://oauth.net/)-protected API in a Python webapp?
[oauth-dropins](https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins) is for you! It's a
collection of drop-in OAuth authentication flows for many popular sites. It
currently supports Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, Dropbox, Blogger,
Tumblr, and WordPress.com, and we expect to add more over time. It also
currently requires [Google App Engine](https://appengine.google.com/) right now,
but we hope to support other platforms in the future.

[Try the demo!](https://oauth-dropins.appspot.com/)

oauth-dropins takes as little as a few lines of code to add to your project. For
example, to use it for Facebook, just add these two lines to your WSGI
application:

    from oauth_dropins import facebook, twitter
    
    application = webapp2.WSGIApplication([
      ...
      ('/facebook/start_oauth', facebook.StartHandler.to('/facebook/oauth_callback')),
      ('/facebook/oauth_callback', facebook.CallbackHandler.to('/next'))]

Then map those URLs in your
[app.yaml](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig#Python_app_yaml_Script_handlers)
and put your [Facebook app](https://developers.facebook.com/apps)'s key and
secret in plain text `facebook_app_id` and `facebook_app_secret` files in your
app's root directory, and you're good to go!

details. Happy hacking!
