Why I'm weird about privacy

_[TL;DR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn't_read) version:
Like everyone, I want to express myself, and I want to control information that
describes me. That traditionally involves people, but now organizations have
data about me too. Controlling that isn't easy, but I'm stubborn, so I try
anyway._

If you know me, you already know I'm weird about privacy. When I explain it to
someone new, they often say, "That's great! More people should pay attention to
that." Eventually, they learn about the
[kinds of things I keep private](/privacy_through_prepaid_credit_cards) and the
[kinds of things I don't](/ryan.barrett.name/bigbrother/), and they get
confused. The distinction isn't always obvious, even to me. I'm not evangelizing -
I just do it for myself - but I'd still like to explore the underlying reason,
if only out of curiosity.

I'll start by listing a few things that _aren't_ the reason. Credit rating.
Identity theft. Direct marketing. Safety. Job hunting. Dating. Illegal/illicit
activities. Shame. Anxiety. Running for elected office.
[Something to hide.](http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Nothing-to-Hide/)
These are all common reasons people care about privacy, but not me.

I've narrowed my reasons down to three things: _self expression_, _control_, and
_data_.

First, self expression. We all want to tell people who we are. We want to assert
that we are this, that we are not that. It reaffirms that we exist, that we're
individuals, that we mean something. It's human nature.

Much has been made of how social networks enable this, but they're just the
latest means to the end. The clothes you wear, the things you say, the people
you hang out with, and the myriad ways you spend your time all form an outward
image for other people's consumption. They see what you do, and it molds who
they think you are. It may be selective and self-conscious, but you're almost
always on display for _someone_.

I may be an introvert, but I care about this as much as the next person. I want
to express myself too, to assert who I am and who I'm not. Writing on
[this web site](http://snarfed.org/) is one way I do that, which can be
confusing. If I'm so big on privacy, why do I post [so much about myself](/about)
here and elsewhere online?

Well, because I _control_ what I post. Like all communication, self expression
depends heavily on control, and control is another natural human urge in its own
right. The simple things, the things I express myself, are easy. I choose to say
this, not wear that, buy this, not vote for that. All of that is comfortably
under my control.

Unfortunately, other things aren't. I may not have chosen to stumble on that
curb, but I still did, and people still saw it. Am I tall? Outgoing? A good
dancer? Who are my family and friends? What do they say about me when I'm not
around? Am I having a bad hair day? All of that is inadvertent, implicit, or
otherwise largely out of my control, but it still contributes to other people's
mental images of me...

...which brings me to _data_. For a long time, people had a monopoly on mental
images of other people. In the last few centuries, organizations like companies
and governments have started building their own profiles of people. My bank
knows that I have a certain income (direct deposit), roughly where I live (ATM
withdrawals), and who I invest with (transfers to my brokerage). That's not very
extensive, but it's something, and it can get much more detailed. Other
organizations know who you've called, where you've been, and which web sites
you've visited, among other things.

Individual organizations like my bank may be limited to a narrow perspective,
but if they partner with my telephone company, for example, or my health care
provider, they can learn a lot more. This kind of data mining and profiling
isn't news, and I don't think it's fundamentally immoral or problematic,
especially given [who I work for](http://google.com/), but it does raise a
dilemma. I'm human, so I have a natural urge to control information about me. I
know how to control what I explicitly disclose, but I also want to control the
_implicit_ information I create as a by-product of living my day to day life,
and thus control the profiles of me that organizations build.

Why do I care what organizations think about me at all? It comes back to self
expression and control. I don't need them to think of me in any specific way,
but I also don't want them to think the _wrong_ thing about me, or more to the
point, something I don't entirely control. I don't have anything concrete to
hide, but
[that doesn't matter](http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Nothing-to-Hide/).
My urge to control things, in this case information about me, is an intrinsic
part of human nature. It's not a means to an end, it's an end in itself.

So, can I control this data? To a large degree, yes. First, I can try not to
leave that bread crumb trail at all. I buy most things with cash instead of
credit or debit cards. I don't give my name, address, or phone number unless
it's absolutely necessary, and often not even then. I cover the
[VIN visible through my car's windshield](http://www.ehow.com/how_7541825_check-classic-cars-vin-number.html).
I block [cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) by default.

<!--
[HIPAA](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/) was passed just
before I signed up for my first employee health care plan, so I bullied them
into assigning me a unique patient ID number instead of my SSN, the pre-HIPAA
default.

I do give out information sometimes! I'll fill out surveys and other marketing
research occasionally, or even more rarely write to customer service, if I feel
strongly. In general though, ...

When I can't avoid leaving a trail, I misdirect. I've developed a habit of
[giving fake names and addresses](/faking_out_address_and_credit_card_forms), or
when the name needs to match my ID - hi, [TSA!](http://www.tsa.gov/) -
misspelling it. If I absolutely need a credit card, I use an
[anonymous prepaid card](/privacy_through_prepaid_credit_cards). I use a prepaid
cell phone plan with no last name or address. I title my cars and real estate in
the name of a
[New Mexico LLC](http://www.howtobeinvisible.com/index.cfm/page/LLCs/) which
can't be traced to me.

Is there any practical motivation for all this? Not really. It doesn't get me a
higher credit rating, or a better reputation, or frequent flier miles, or
[more followers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/schnarfed). It does help
prevent identity theft, and maybe some legal liability, but there are much
better ways to do that.

It's actually worse. My
[prepaid credit cards](/privacy_through_prepaid_credit_cards) aren't reloadable,
so I'm constantly buying new ones. I have to keep track of which fake names I've
used where. "Official" activities like voting, renewing my driver's license, and
buying real estate are fragile, Rube-Goldberg-meets-MC-Escher balancing acts.

The sad truth is, the only real motivation is the principle of the thing. Like
many engineers, I'm burdened with an inconvenient personality quirk: if
something is theoretically right, I pursue it, doggedly, even if it's annoying,
unrealistic, or downright painful.

To recap: I'm human, so I want to express myself and control information that
describes me. Organizations now have data about me, so I want to control that
too. That's not easy to do in practice, but my personality makes me try anyway.
