Hipster or crazy?

My new office is at
[Market and 6th](http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2013/03/01/warfield-theater-sold-to-sonoma-investor.html),
which is a fun neighborhood. We're on the seventh floor, which affords a great
view of the myriad drug deals, crazy people dancing in the street, games of
chicken between ambulances and buses (and occasional street cleaner or
high-as-a-kite community member), and other neighborhood spectator sports.

One of the best games so far is "hipster or crazy?" Self explanatory; also
awesome.

We're probably going to hell, but hey, look on the bright side, I hear they have
trivia nights!
