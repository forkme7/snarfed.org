I'm heading out on vacation for the next week, hanging out with a herd of family
in [Gulf Shores, Alabama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Shores,_Alabama). It
hasn't been long since [my last vacation](/2009-03-16_vacation), and
there's a lot going on at work, as usual...but life is too short to stay home
for long!

I don't plan to check mail much, so if you don't get a reply, that's probably
why. See you in a week!

_Updated:_ [pictures](/family_reunion_2009_gulf_shores) are up!
