Sitting at my [dining room table](/2010-08-27_table_pictures), listening to
Herbie Hancock, drinking [good beer](/beer), enjoying the view out my window, and
hacking on
[Emacs Lisp](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/index.html).
Damn fine Saturday afternoon.

...too bad it'll
[all be over in a few hours](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/05/21/MNP41JJA8B.DTL).
Oh well. We had a good run!
