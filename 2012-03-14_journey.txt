I just finished playing _[Journey](http://thatgamecompany.com/games/journey/)_.
It was amazing, as I'd hoped. [thatgamecompany](http://www.thatgamecompany.com/)
is so damn good at their craft.

Sadly though, the automatic, drop-in multiplayer actually detracted from my
experience. I thought they'd only use it sparingly, which could have worked, but
instead they paired me with other players for most of the game.

They do such a great job building this haunting, mysterious, lonely world, and
then ruin it by sticking you with a pesky kid brother. Hey, jump jump jump, beep
beep, oh wow look over here I found something! Ooh, is that a puzzle? I can
solve that, here, let me!

Sigh. I could play it again with ethernet unplugged, but I've already
experienced the (ahem) journey, so it won't have the same impact. I have to
admit, I'm a bit disappointed.

I listened to
[Robin Hunicke's talk at GameCity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KasceIfLySg)
from earlier this year, where she explained their motivation. They really wanted
the one on one interaction to be a central part of the game, not just an add-on,
and they definitely succeeded at that.

My discomfort may say more about me than anything else. I love exploring in
games, especially when they have such a rich, atmospheric world. I'm also very
introverted. Journey used an admirably light touch, and I could walk away from
the other person at any time, but in the end, even just knowing they were there
detracted from the immersion.

It's still a great game, and I highly recommend it. If you play it, though,
and you're an explorer like me, consider signing out of PSN first.
