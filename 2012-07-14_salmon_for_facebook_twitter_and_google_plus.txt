Salmon for Facebook, Twitter, and Google+

I've just published
[salmon-unofficial](https://github.com/snarfed/salmon-unofficial), a stand-in
[Salmon](http://salmon-protocol.org/) server for major sites that don't
implement it themselves. It's up and running at
[salmon-unofficial.appspot.com](https://salmon-unofficial.appspot.com/) with
implementations for Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.

This complements the unofficial
[WebFinger](/2012-01-16_webfinger_for_facebook_and_twitter),
[PortableContacts](/2012-02-22_portablecontacts_for_facebook_and_twitter), and
[ActivityStreams](/2012-03-12_activitystreams_for_facebook_and_twitter) providers
I've published recently. They're all just little side projects, and may not be
hugely useful on their own, but they do constitute almost a complete suite of
[OStatus bridge apps](/2011-07-27_facebook_app_for_ostatus) for the major social
networking sites. Only [OStatus](http://ostatus.org/about) itself is left!

As usual with Salmon, I'm still working on interoperability.
[StatusNet](http://status.net/) is probably the most mature, but it's still not
handling my slaps yet. Details in
[my notes](https://github.com/snarfed/salmon-unofficial/blob/master/notes).
[Diaspora's implementation](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Diaspora%27s-federation-protocol)
has historically
[skewed from the spec](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/salmon-protocol/A0pxsEl32Cc/oelFuGNun1AJ),
but I still need to try others like [Friendica](http://friendica.com/),
[rstatus](http://www.rstat.us/), and
[node-ostatus](https://github.com/eschnou/node-ostatus). Let me know if you have
experience with Salmon interop, I'd love help!

Feedback and pull requests are welcome!
