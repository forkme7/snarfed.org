[SWAT0](http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/SWAT0) is a
social web interoperability test. The first
[indieweb](https://indiewebcamp.com/) demo
[happened in July 2015](http://indiewebcamp.com/SWAT0#2015-07-12_B_A_K). Here's
the outline:

> 1. With their phone, A takes a photo, tags it with B, and uploads it using a service
> 1. B gets a notification on another service that they've been tagged in a photo
> 1. C, who is subscribed to A, sees the photo on yet another service
> 1. C comments on the photo
> 1. A and B receive notifications that C has commented on the photo

[Silo SWAT0](http://indiewebcamp.com/SWAT0#Silo_SWAT0) is a variant where one or
two people (but not all three) participate entirely inside a
[silo](http://indiewebcamp.com/silo). The other participant(s) interact with the
silo participants via [POSSE](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE),
[backfeed](https://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed), and silo feed proxies and
converters like [facebook-atom](https://facebook-atom.appspot.com/).

[Kyle Mahan](https://kylewm.com/) and I did an end to end silo SWAT0 test on
Facebook on 2015-11-16. We did another with [Ben Werdmülller](http://werd.io/)
live at
[Homebrew Website Club on 2015-11-18](http://indiewebcamp.com/events/2015-11-18-homebrew-website-club).
We think these were the first ever, at least on purpose. (Ironically, the tools
and services we used have been up and running for a while, with many users, so
it's probably already happened many times over without anyone noticing.)

The first time, fake user
[Snoøpy Barrett](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009447618341)
(driven by me) was A, I was Facebook-only user B, and Kyle was C. The second
time, I was A, Ben was B, and Kyle was C. The sequence of events and tools used
were the same both times. Here's the first, illustrated:

1a. Snoopy (A) takes a picture,
   [posts it to snarfed.org](https://snarfed.org/chillin_2) (WordPress) with the
   [WordPress Android app](http://android.wordpress.org/), and tags me (B) by
   including a `u-category h-card` link to `snarfed.org`.

1b. Snoopy also includes a [Bridgy Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publish)
   link in the post. The
   [WordPress Webmention plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/) sees
   it and sends a webmention to Bridgy, which
   [triggers it to POSSE the post](https://brid.gy/about#webmentions) to
   Facebook.

1c. [The picture appears on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1520050698319836&set=a.1520022318322674.1073741827.100009447618341&type=3&permPage=1), with me tagged.

2. Facebook notifies me that Snoopy tagged me in a picture.

3. Kyle (C) uses [Woodwind](http://reader.kylewm.com/) as his reader and
   subscribes to his Facebook news feed via
   [facebook-atom](http://facebook-atom.appspot.com/). He's friends with Snoopy,
   so the Facebook photo post appears in Woodwind.

<a href="/silo_swat0/3_comment_in_woodwind.jpg"><img class="step" src="/silo_swat0/3_comment_in_woodwind.jpg" /></a>

4a. Woodwind supports inline commenting, liking, and reposting via
 [micropub](http://micropub.net/). Kyle comments on the picture inside Woodwind,
 which posts the comment to [his site](https://kylewm.com/), running
 [Redwind](https://github.com/kylewm/redwind).

4b. Redwind POSSEs the comment to Facebook using [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/).

5a. Facebook notifies me of the comment.

<a href="/silo_swat0/5_comment_notif_B.png"><img class="step" src="/silo_swat0/5_comment_notif_B.png" /></a>


5a. Bridgy polls Snoopy's Facebook posts, sees the comment, and backfeeds it to
    the [original post](https://snarfed.org/chillin_2) via webmention. The
    WordPress [webmention](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/) and
    [semantic-linkbacks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks/)
    plugins receive the webmention, fetch the comment from Bridgy (translated
    from Facebook's API into
    [microformats2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2)), and add it
    to the original post as comments.

5b. This triggers WordPress to email Snoopy and notify him of the comment.
