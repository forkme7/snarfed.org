Silo SWAT0 on Facebook

[SWAT0](http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/SWAT0) is a
social web interoperability test. The first
[indieweb](https://indiewebcamp.com/) demo
[happened in July 2015]((http://indiewebcamp.com/SWAT0#2015-07-12_B_A_K).

1. With their phone, A takes a photo, tags it with B, and uploads it using a service
1. B gets a notification on another service that they've been tagged in a photo
1. C, who is subscribed to A, sees the photo on yet another service
1. C comments on the photo
1. A and B receive notifications that C has commented on the photo

[Silo SWAT0](http://indiewebcamp.com/SWAT0#Silo_SWAT0) is a variant where one or
two people (but not all three) participate entirely inside a
[silo](http://indiewebcamp.com/silo). The other participant(s) interact with the
silo participants via [POSSE](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE),
[backfeed](https://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed), and silo feed proxies and
converters like [facebook-atom](https://facebook-atom.appspot.com/).

[Kyle Mahan](https://kylewm.com/) and I did an end to end silo SWAT0 test on
Facebook today. Fake user
[Sno√∏py Barrett](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009447618341) was A,
I was silo-only user B, and Kyle was C. Here's the sequence of events.

1. Snoopy (A) [posts a picture on snarfed.org](https://snarfed.org/chillin_2)
   (WordPress) and tags me (B).
