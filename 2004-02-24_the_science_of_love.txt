I just read a [really cool article](http://www.economist.com/node/2424049)
in the latest Economist. Scientists have made progress understanding the
science, genetics, and neurochemistry of love. Yeah, you read that right.
_Love._

My favorite quote:

> Parts of the brain that are love-bitten include the one
> responsible for gut feelings, and the ones which generate
> the euphoria induced by drugs such as cocaine. So the
> brains of people deeply in love do not look like those of
> people experiencing strong emotions, but instead like
> those of people snorting coke.

It's very worth reading. Also, this book is listed as a reference, which might
be cool:
