Now, about that name...

I've released a new version of [cdname.py](/cdname_py), which reads
[CDDB](http://www.gracenote.com/gn_products/cddb.html)/[freedb](http://freedb.org/)
INF files and uses them to name MP3s. This release includes the ability to
generate M3U playlists, as well as a few small bug fixes. Drop, drop, drop it
while it's...I mean, [grab it while it's hot](/cdname_py)!
