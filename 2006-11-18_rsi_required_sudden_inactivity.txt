RSI: Required, Sudden Inactivity

I've come down with a pretty bad case of [RSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury). It's awful. I'm taking it seriously, so I'm cutting out most non-work-related typing for a while, including email, IM, [side projects](/software), and posting here.

I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do with myself. Please, for the love of god, wish me a speedy recovery!
