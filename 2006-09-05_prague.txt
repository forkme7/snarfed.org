Prague!

<p class="right"><img class="shadow" src="/prague_charles_bridge.jpg" /></p>

I'm posting this from an internet cafe in the heart of Prague, in the Czech
Republic. I'm here for the next week and a half or so on vacation. I'm going to
a wedding, spending time with friends, and doing the whole touristy sightseeing
thing.

It's been over a year since I went on vacation, so I'm definitely enjoying it.
If you don't get quick replies to emails, that's why. On the other hand, if
you're anywhere in Europe during the next couple weeks,
[let me know](/about)! EasyJet and RyanAir are next door.
