First, agree on the goal

<p class="right"><img class="shadow" src="soccer_goal.jpg" /></p>

I recently had a conversation about nutrition that turned into a bit of a
debate. I'm sure you've heard it before: "I eat this, you should try it!" "No,
you should eat this! And that other thing, right after you exercise." "OK, but
do it in small portions, regularly throughout the day." "No no, it's all just
calories in, calories out."

We could have argued for hours, if we hadn't realized something that stopped us
in our tracks: we all had different goals in mind. "Wait, wait. You're talking
about losing weight, right? And you must be talking about physical fitness. And
I'm just talking about being healthy." Smiles all around, bitter argument
averted, we moved on to more important matters: deconstructing the

We tend to think other people are like ourselves. Sure, we can spot outward
differences like height or age, but deeper personality traits are more
difficult. We know which of our friends are athletic, or thoughtful, or funny,
but maybe not that Alice tends to overspend on hotel rooms, or that Bob avoids
clothes with visible logos.

Even if we do know those things, it takes
[too much mental energy](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?pagewanted=all)
to pull them all into working memory every time we talk with someone. Instead,
we take a shortcut: we substitute ourselves. We know own beliefs and preferences
intimately, so it's trivial to imagine what we would do in any situation.

This usually works well. Human nature is a powerful force, and it's made us much
more similar than we are different. This substitution technique is so successful
that we all adopt it early in life, and it becomes so automatic that we rarely
notice when it happens.
[Daniel Kahneman describes this](http://books.google.com/books?id=ZuKTvERuPG8C)
in elegant detail.

Unfortunately, we're not all identical, so substitution sometimes guesses wrong.
That wouldn't be so bad if we were aware of it, but it's so ingrained that we
blame the other person, or the communication medium, or anything except our own
lazy, shortcut-prone brain.

We often see this in practice when we assume other people share our goals.
Whether it's a political debate, brainstorming at work, or a family meeting,
people often skip straight to problem solving mode. They don't bother to check
that they have the same goal in mind, or even if they agree on what the problem
is!

Keith Ferrazzi's book
_[Never Eat Alone](http://books.google.com/books?id=N_XIEQmc9YcC)_ is one of my
favorite examples. It's about networking and building business relationships,
and not surprisingly, it advocates always having lunch with other people.

I understand the idea. I also treasure the occasional chance I have to eat
alone. I'm an introvert, so
[being with people drains me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Introversion),
and some work days are so packed with meetings and collaboration that I need
that alone time to recharge my batteries and get through the day.

At first, I thought the book was silly and misguided. I couldn't help but wonder
if it might be on to something, though, and maybe the problem was on my end. I
eventually realized that we just had different goals.

Ferrazzi assumes that everyone wants to succeed in business, so his
recommendation is
[normative](https://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Anormative) for everyone:
_never eat alone_. Business and career are all well and good, but they're not
high priorities for me. If recharging at lunch means I end up with fewer
business relationships, so be it. Ferazzi and I are both right; we just have
different goals.

What's the takeaway? Pay attention to your assumptions. Try to notice when you
make a judgment based on what you'd do, instead of what someone else would do.
Put yourself in their shoes instead, or even better, ask them explicitly what
their goal is. If yours is different, nail down a shared goal first.

Oh, and nutrition? It's a tar pit. It's incredibly hard to research
scientifically, and the constant fads and pseudoscience outweigh what little
decent research there is. Don't overthink it! Eat healthy foods, moderate,
exercise, and do what works for you.
