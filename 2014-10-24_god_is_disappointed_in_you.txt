_[God is Disappointed in You](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17689005-god-is-disappointed-in-you)_
is a short-and-sweet retelling of the Bible with modern language and an
unrelenting sense of humor. It's hilarious. Here are some of my favorite quotes
so far.

> God “discovered” the Promised Land in much the same way that my mother
> discovered the Olive Garden. Everybody already knew about it, and it was
> already full of people when she got there, but hey, unlimited breadsticks.  
> <br />
> When the Jews arrived at the Promised Land, they were a little irked to find
> the place overrun with pagans...God ordered them to celebrate by killing all
> the men, women and children. He also ordered them to kill their cattle and
> their sheep and throw all their belongings into a bonfire, as if [they] never
> existed. So it was sort of like, “You know, maybe we really did discover the
> Olive Garden.”

> God took a shine to a 75 year-old man named Abraham...Abraham’s descendants
> would be his chosen people. To finalize the deal, Abraham agreed to cut a tiny
> bit off the penis of every man who would ever be born into his family.
> Contracts worked differently back then.

> Jacob's real rock bottom moment, though, came when he broke his arm wrestling
> with an angel. God changed Jacob’s name to “Israel,” which means “one who
> wrestles with God.” As far as I know, Israel is still the only nation named
> after a wrestler.

> God told Moses to take his people into the desert and await further
> instructions. The Egyptians had made running a government look easy, but Moses
> quickly learned that it’s actually kind of a grind, especially when you’re
> leading a nation of people on what is going to be a 40-year nature hike.

> Wherever they went, tens of thousands of Israelites would suddenly show up
> uninvited, trampling the grass, devouring the crops, and drinking everything
> in sight. They were like a plague of locusts or hippies.

> “If you do these things and observe all the other laws I’ve given you, then
> God will lift you above all other nations. If you don’t, then God will send a
> hairy foreigner to steal your girlfriend...And if God wants you to do
> something, don’t ask too many questions, just do it, even if it’s kind of
> weird.

> Samuel came across a handsome teenager named Saul, who was out looking for
> some lost donkeys. Thinking this was some sort of sign, Samuel made Saul king.
> It turns out that donkey-catching is not the best qualification for being a
> head of state, and Saul was something of a disaster.

> “Nice, David, really nice,” Michal said, scolding him. “It’s bad enough that
> you did that God-awful dance, but then to expose yourself? To the slaves and
> everyone?”  
> David mumbled defensively.  
> “What did you say?” Michal growled.  
> “I said it was just a tip slip.”  
> “It was a humiliation, is what it was! What, were you raised by farm animals?”  
> “Sort of.”  
> David did not like being reminded of his redneck past. He went to
> bed without even giving Michal a goodnight kiss. Apparently God apparently
> took David’s side, because he cursed Michal with infertility, which may or may
> not be a nice way of saying that David stopped sleeping with her.

> In my last letter, I got a little carried away and implied that the world was
> about to come to an end. I’m sorry if I misled you. Hopefully none of you made
> any major purchases.

> Be sure to pass the collection plate at the beginning of the week when people
> have money rather than at the end of the week, when everyone’s broke. I know
> this is difficult seeing as how you have your services on Saturday and all, but
> it’s important to hit people up when they’ve actually got the cash. If need be,
> we can always move our church services to Sunday.

> Isn’t it great to be a Christian? You used to be a bunch of crazy pagans,
> running around, jumping on the furniture, having sex with whoever you wanted.
> But thanks to the power of Jesus Christ, you’ve been transformed into new,
> fulfilling lives, full of self-denial and persecution.

...and my favorite piece of trivia so far: before the devil was named Beelzebub,
he was named Baal. I'm fascinated when a culture gives a single god or deity
multiple names, and I've always loved the (Judeo-Christian) devil's - Beelzebub,
Lucifer, Satan - but I didn't know, or maybe forgot, that Baal preceded them
all. Even better, Baal wasn't anything special in his time, just one of the many
gods worshipped by the different Hebrew tribes.

> Jehu asked the priests of Baal to meet him at their temple, so he could get
> off on the right foot with their god. This turned out to be a sting operation.
> When they showed up, Jehu killed all the priests. Then he converted Baal’s
> temple into a public restroom. As a joke, Jehu changed the sign on the doorway
> from Beelzebul, which meant “Baal: Lord of the Heavens” to Beelzebub, which
> meant “Baal: Lord of Flies.”
