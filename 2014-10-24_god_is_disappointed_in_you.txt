_[God is Disappointed in You](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17689005-god-is-disappointed-in-you)_
is a short-and-sweet retelling of the Bible with modern language and an
unrelenting sense of humor. It's hilarious. Here are some of my favorite quotes
so far.

> God “discovered” the Promised Land in much the same way that my mother
> discovered the Olive Garden. Everybody already knew about it, and it was
> already full of people when she got there, but hey, unlimited breadsticks.
>
> When the Jews arrived at the Promised Land, they were a little irked to find
> the place overrun with pagans...Whenever the Jews won a battle, God ordered
> them to celebrate by killing all the men, women and children. He also ordered
> them to kill their cattle and their sheep and throw all their belongings into
> a bonfire, as if [they] never existed. So it was sort of like, “You know,
> maybe we really did discover the Olive Garden.”

> God took a shine to a 75 year-old man named Abraham...Abraham’s descendants
> would be his chosen people. To finalize the deal, Abraham agreed to cut a tiny
> bit off the penis of every man who would ever be born into his family.
> Contracts worked differently back then.

> His real rock bottom moment, though, came when he broke his arm wrestling with
> an angel. God changed Jacob’s name to “Israel,” which means “one who wrestles
> with God.” As far as I know, Israel is still the only nation named after a
> wrestler.

> God told Moses to take his people into the desert and await further
> instructions. The Egyptians had made running a government look easy, but Moses
> quickly learned that it’s actually kind of a grind, especially when you’re
> leading a nation of people on what is going to be a 40-year nature hike.

> Wherever they went, tens of thousands of Israelites would suddenly show up
> uninvited, trampling the grass, devouring the crops, and drinking everything
> in sight. They were like a plague of locusts or hippies.

> “If you do these things and observe all the other laws I’ve given you, then
> God will lift you above all other nations. If you don’t, then God will send a
> hairy foreigner to steal your girlfriend...And if God wants you to do
> something, don’t ask too many questions, just do it, even if it’s kind of
> weird.

> Samuel came across a handsome teenager named Saul, who was out looking for
> some lost donkeys. Thinking this was some sort of sign, Samuel made Saul king.
> It turns out that donkey-catching is not the best qualification for being a
> head of state, and Saul was something of a disaster.

> “Nice, David, really nice,” Michal said, scolding him. “It’s bad enough that
> you did that God-awful dance, but then to expose yourself? To the slaves and
> everyone?”
> David mumbled defensively.
> “What did you say?” Michal growled.
> “I said it was just a tip slip.”
> “It was a humiliation, is what it was! What, were you raised by farm animals?”
> “Sort of.” David did not like being reminded of his redneck past. He went to
> bed without even giving Michal a goodnight kiss. Apparently God apparently
> took David’s side, because he cursed Michal with infertility, which may or may
> not be a nice way of saying that David stopped sleeping with her.

...and my favorite piece of trivia so far: the devil was named Baal before he
was named Beelzebub. I'm fascinated with gods and deities who have multiple
names, and I've always loved the devil's names - Beelzebub, Lucifer, Satan - but
I didn't know (or maybe forgot) that Baal preceded them all. Even better, in his
time, Baal wasn't anything special, just yet another God worshipped by a handful
of Hebrew tribes.

> Jehu asked the priests of Baal to meet him at their temple, so he could get
> off on the right foot with their god. This turned out to be a sting operation.
> When they showed up, Jehu killed all the priests. Then he converted Baal’s
> temple into a public restroom. As a joke, Jehu changed the sign on the doorway
> from Beelzebul, which meant “Baal: Lord of the Heavens” to Beelzebub, which
> meant “Baal: Lord of Flies.”
