[Amano](http://www.amanochocolate.com/), one of
[my favorite makers](/chocolate), recently held a
["guess the origin" contest](http://www.seventypercent.com/2010/06/amano-new-origin-competition-win-a-years-supply-of-chocolate/)
to stir up buzz for a new bar they're introducing. I wasn't enough of a
cacao expert to guess, but I was still excited.

When they announced the answer, I wasn't just excited. I was shocked. Amano's
new chocolate is from the [Chuao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuao) region of
Venezuela, a prized cacao source widely thought to produce the best beans in the
world. It's so well known that some makers have even
[named themselves after it](http://www.chuaochocolatier.com/about.html).

For a long time, [Amedei](http://www.amedei.com/) has been the only way for fans
to get at Chuao's cacao, since they had an exclusive deal with the village.
Evidently Chuao is finally branching out, though. Good for them, and good for us
too! I can't wait to try Amano's take on these famous beans.

Thanks to [Seventypercent.com](http://www.seventypercent.com/)
for their [hands on report](http://www.seventypercent.com/2010/06/amano-chuao/).
