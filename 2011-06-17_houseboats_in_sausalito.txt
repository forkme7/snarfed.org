A couple weeks ago, I went [kayaking in Sausalito](http://seatrek.com/) for the
day with my family and Gina. We wandered around the north bay, played tag with
sailboats and ferries (even if they didn't know it), made friends and enemies
with seals, and started absolutely no water fights at all. None. Not one!

The best part of the adventure was the
[houseboat community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausalito,_California#Houseboats)
on the northern edge of the town.

Some were anchored out in the bay, but most were in long term slips in dedicated
marinas. The
[neighborhood](http://www.oursausalito.com/houseboats-in-sausalito.html) was big
enough that you could honestly call it a neighborhood, complete with streets and
intersections, an [HOA](http://www.floatinghomes.org/), and best of all, some
utterly fascinating architecture.

Most of the houseboats looked fairly normal, more or less, even if they had more
character than your average landlocked Tudor or Craftsman. The area
[has always attracted offbeat, quirky people](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/10/04/HO30755.DTL&type=travel),
though, so plenty were just plain weird, which generally meant _awesome_.

The [Taj Mahal](http://www.oursausalito.com/taj-mahal-houseboat.html) may be the
most famous, but there were plenty of other amazing oddities. One was a squat,
angular, gleaming spaceship. Another cloaked itself in a sprawling, wraparound
rainbow mural. One was made entirely from squares and right angles, a tribute to
minimalist, modern design. Others ranged from Burning Man art car and repurposed
train locomotive to trashy, falling down chic and haunted house monstrosity. We
loved them all.

Paddling down inlets and around corners in search of the next surreal
masterpiece was the highlight of the day. We called out to each other to show
off our latest finds, laughed at the particularly crazy bits, and compared our
favorites over dinner afterward.

Others have
[written about them more eloquently](http://www.norcalyak.com/2010/01/sea-kayaking-in-sausalito.html),
so I'll just say that the Sausalito houseboats were the unexpected bit of pure
joy that made our day. They were definitely worth the visit.
